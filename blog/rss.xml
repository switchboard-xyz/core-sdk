            <description><![CDATA[In the previous article, we covered the “Why build Switchboard v3?” and the technology, Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) behind itIn this article, we’ll discuss the whats and hows of v3.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Switchboard Serverless offers a suite of computing services that enables
developers to build the future of blockchain applications.</p><p>In the previous <a href="/blog/2023/03/30/Switchboard-v3">Switchboard-v3 article</a>, we
covered the “Why build Switchboard v3?” and the technology, Trusted Execution
Environment (TEE) behind it. In this article, we’ll discuss the whats and hows
of v3.</p><p>In the previous iteration, v2 offers a great infrastructure — the standard
“honest” staked nodes consensus model. Switchboard v3 introduces a new paradigm
and a greater solution when building with oracles, providing a secure,
verifiable and customizable solution to tailor fit to your data and off-chain
execution needs.</p><h1>About TEEs</h1><p>A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a specialized hardware that specializes
in <strong>data software integrity and privacy</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="what-are-tees">What are TEEs?<a href="#what-are-tees" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are TEEs?" title="Direct link to What are TEEs?">​</a></h2><p>TEEs represents a secure environment within a machine’s hardware or software
that is isolated from the operating system and other applications. TEEs are
designed to provide a trusted and secure environment where sensitive information
can be processed without the risk of being accessed or modified by unauthorized
parties. TEEs can attest another TEE to be running a particular software. TEEs
are commonly used in mobile devices, banking or digital wallets to provide
secure storage for sensitive data.</p><p>In a blockchain context, TEEs can be used to securely store private keys for
blockchain wallets, ensuring that they cannot be accessed by unauthorized
parties. TEEs can also be used to securely process blockchain transactions,
ensuring that they cannot be tampered with or modified by hackers or malicious
actors.</p><h1>Switchboard Attestation Program</h1><p>In the aforementioned <a href="/blog/2023/03/30/Switchboard-v3">Switchboard-v3 article</a>,
Switchboard v2 was built around economic security models where data reporters
are rewarded or slashed relative to how close or far they were to the median of
all data reporters. To participate in a
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/queue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Switchboard Queue</a>, oracle operators are
required to <strong>lock up some portion of economic stake</strong> specified by the queue as
well as <strong>explicit operating approval</strong> from the oracle queue’s authority.</p><p>The economic stake combined with the authority-gated operating permission can be
“sufficient” to fulfil decentralization BUT it limits oracle honesty incentives
to the amount they staked.</p><p>Take example where an oracle is supporting a 1 million dollar TVL DeFi protocol,
can the oracle’s stake be aligned? Should the oracle be at risk of losing
millions of dollars if it misreports? This method introduces additional
challenges with capital efficiency, but Switchboard v3 aims to tackle this.</p><p>By utilizing TEE’s technology, we can:</p><ul><li>Create a digital signature of the software loaded into it;</li><li>Create a signature of any data generated from within the code.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="verifying-the-oracles">Verifying the Oracles<a href="#verifying-the-oracles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Verifying the Oracles" title="Direct link to Verifying the Oracles">​</a></h2><p>In Switchboard’s case, oracles are encapsulated within TEEs, allowing it to
create a unique digital signature — a public key of a signing keypair, where we
post on-chain for all to verify. In short, these oracles can be trusted but yet
verifiable!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="verifying-the-execution">Verifying the Execution<a href="#verifying-the-execution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Verifying the Execution" title="Direct link to Verifying the Execution">​</a></h2><p>Once these oracles are verified and begin to participate in a queue. All user
requests such as data feeds, functions, etc can be verifiably executed, where
people can verify that the transactions being sent are strictly dictated by the
code that created it.</p><p><strong><em>Read more about TEEs, Switchboard Attestation Program</em></strong>
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/v3/attestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><h1>Switchboard Serverless</h1><p>Attention developers! Yes, you saw that right. With Switchboard v3, apart from
improving security by verifying oracles and its executions, Switchboard
Serverless offers a suit of developer toolings through a serverless approach
such that developers’ requests are matched with an oracle, eliminating the need
to provision, operate, manage, or worry about any infrastructure or servers. The
suite of developer toolings are mentioned in the following.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="switchboard-services">Switchboard Services<a href="#switchboard-services" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Switchboard Services" title="Direct link to Switchboard Services">​</a></h2><p>Switchboard Services enables developers to write and deploy functions as part of
data feeds — designed to perform specific tasks. With v3, developers can access
powerful, customizable and scalable solutions to build and deploy services such
as:</p><p>Examples of Switchboard Services: Complex Risk Engines; Advanced Filtering;
GameFi</p><ul><li>Create complex risk engines that performs calculations based on private market
data which feeds directly into a DeFi protocol;</li><li>Develop advanced filtering functions to aggregate, verify and filter off-chain
data from multiple sources using custom logic to build dynamic applications;</li><li>Create complex automation flows for your application which can include
processing data, sending notifications, updating a database and more!</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="switchboard-streams">Switchboard Streams<a href="#switchboard-streams" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Switchboard Streams" title="Direct link to Switchboard Streams">​</a></h2><p>Switchboard Streams are data feeds and technically a subset of Services, but
specifically designed to fetch data from on/off-chain data sources. The
Switchboard Builder enables developers to create Streams seamlessly and with
full customizability. With v3, the oracles’ execution of the jobs and tasks
within each Streams are now verifiable — this helps DeFi protocols to align
incentives with oracle operators.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="switchboard-secrets">Switchboard Secrets<a href="#switchboard-secrets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Switchboard Secrets" title="Direct link to Switchboard Secrets">​</a></h2><p>Switchboard Secrets provides developers a secure and confidential way to access
private/gated APIs and data from off-chain sources. With v3, sensitive
information can be processed and updated securely.</p><p>Examples of Switchboard Secrets: Gated/private sports, price data; Off-chain API
keys such as OpenAI and social media platforms</p><ul><li>Accessibility to reliable sports, price data;</li><li>OpenAI API key;</li><li>Social media (Discord, Slack, Twitter) API key;</li><li>and so much more!</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="switchboard-pseudorandomness">Switchboard pSeudorandomness<a href="#switchboard-pseudorandomness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Switchboard pSeudorandomness" title="Direct link to Switchboard pSeudorandomness">​</a></h2><p>Switchboard pSeudorandomness is a randomness service and Verifiable Random
Function (VRF) for generating secure and verifiable on-chain randomness using
TEE oracles.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>In conclusion, the Switchboard v3 oracle network paired with the suite of
products offered through Switchboard Serverless enables developers to access
verifiable off-chain computation and data, empowering them to build exceptional
products for other developers and end-users.</p><p><strong><em>Join us to revolutionize the standard and plug in a new paradigm of

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bringing back the ‘Dialed in with Switchboard’ series where we wrap up
Switchboard’s endeavours every quarterly!</p><p>In 2023 Q1, Switchboard continues to strive for excellence in areas such as the
ongoing Switchboard Expansion and growing our developer community!</p><h1>Statistics</h1><p>Our statistics on Solana has improved overall, such as increasing our percentage
of transactions to 8–10% of total Solana transactions; and other achievements
like doubling our VRF requests count since last quarter.</p><p>Check out the dashboard
<a href="https://analytics.topledger.xyz/switchboard/public/dashboards/Fydkqa8BQYjPbv6kTGiO2KwXwtHepQ9P1cs2f7rV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Switchboard 2023 Q1 Statistics on Solana</p><h1>Community-led Solana Hackathon</h1><p>Switchboard kicked off the year with a community initiated hackathon, Solana
Sandstorm hosted by LamportDAO and Helius Labs.</p><p>Switchboard’s vision is to empower developers from any community and ecosystem
to build seamlessly and permissionlessly. Hence, this hackathon allowed us to
reach these developers to empower them via a workshop and grant to help them
continue build their project.</p><p>From this hackathon, we hosted a Switchboard Oracle integration track where the
most interesting use case will receive a $1,000 USD grant. At the end of the 2
week event, we received a total of 14 submissions out of 267 and 4 of these
projects (including the winner) have continued to build till the time of
writing.</p><p>More importantly, we managed to highlight to developers the ease of building on
Switchboard and helped these developers to build unique use cases such as:</p><ul><li>The first Formula 1 fantasy game using Switchboard’s data feeds to fetch real
world events.</li><li>No-loss lottery protocols using randomness to derive a winner out of the
participated pool.</li></ul><h1>The Switchboard Expansion</h1><p>Apart from the community wins, in this quarter, we’ve expanded to 2 more
ecosystems. We’re now on Core DAO mainnet and Starknet goerli-alpha!</p><p>Check out our Github links for

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Presenting Switchboard v3 — an oracle protocol using <strong>Trusted Execution
Environments</strong> (TEEs).</p><h1>Current oracle consensus mechanisms</h1><p>Today, most oracle protocols achieve consensus using trusted nodes to aggregate
results to publish on-chain. For example, a price feed involves a number of
oracles aggregating a number of results from different sources and publishing
the results on-chain.</p><p>From the example, this carries the assumption of an honest majority of nodes
answering correctly. This introduces additional overhead of additional network
fees (to incentivise oracles) and latency waiting for sources to respond/network
propagation.</p><p>Additionally, if an oracle is responsible for securing millions of TVL on each
update, shouldn’t the oracle be at risk of losing millions of dollars on each
update to align on incentives? This form of economic majority introduces
additional challenges with capital efficiency.</p><p>What if there was a way to use verifiable computation and cryptography so that
you didn’t need to rely exclusively on an economic majority for every
transaction? What if you could rely on just 1 of N nodes to respond and know the
result was accurate?</p><h1>How is Switchboard v3 different?</h1><p>TRUST BUT VERIFY!</p><p>Switchboard v3’s TEEs enable oracles to become verifiable, offering low latency,
low cost and most importantly verifiable compute services.</p><ul><li>Data retrieval was indeed from the configured source;</li><li>Code execution was executed as intended.</li></ul><p>To simply put it, when you tell the oracles to do XYZ, the oracles can execute
the jobs and publish the data, all in a verifiable manner.</p><h1>Current usage: Switchboard v2</h1><p>Since inception, Switchboard believes in a developer-first approach where we’ve
empowered developers with the necessary tools to explore, build and manage data
feeds — such as the Explorer and Publisher.</p><p><a href="https://switchboard.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://switchboard.xyz</a></p><h1>Future usage: Switchboard v3</h1><p>Being able to offer verifiable compute services as part of feed creation allows
for:</p><ul><li>Fast &amp; secure data feeds</li><li>Incorporate advanced calculations &amp; risk metrics into price feeds</li><li>Customized logic &amp; support for any API</li><li>and much more!</li></ul><p>A literal switchboard.</p><p>Now, imagine yourself as a developer, in a world where a literal web3
<em>switchboard</em> is accessible, where you plug and play with data, tools, services,
all provided by Switchboard Services!</p><h1>Wen v3?</h1><p>Stay plugged in! We’re heads down finalizing on our Switchboard v3 iteration.
Soon, we will be natively implemented on all of the chains we support and more
to come!</p><p>Looking to discuss TEEs, integrate with Switchboard v3 or partner with us?

ZK-Rollup). It operates as an L2 network over Ethereum, enabling any
decentralised application to achieve unlimited scale for its computation —
without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security.</p><p>With the features of being a scalable, composable and general purpose L2
blockchain, this inlines with the visions of Switchboard oracle protocol.
Switchboard Labs is excited to officially announce the expansion of Switchboard
protocol to <strong>Starknet</strong> blockchain!</p><h1><em>What does Switchboard bring to the Starknet ecosystem?</em></h1><p>By bringing our oracle network to Starknet, developers are empowered and
equipped with the set of tools to fetch on/off-chain data to plug into their use
cases. Data such as price, sports, weather data can be brought on-chain to bring
many ideas into fruition and ultimately, enhancing the end users’ experience.</p><p>Additionally, being a permissionless oracle protocol, Switchboard has built a
low-code interface on our <a href="https://app.switchboard.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publisher app</a> that
reduces friction for developers. Instead of going through layers of contacts to
spin up any data feed, on Switchboard’s Publisher, a developer can build their
data feeds within minutes and have full customisability, management over their
own feeds.</p><p>Ultimately, this will help enhance current and future developers’ building

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the recent
<a href="https://solana.com/news/solana-network-upgrades" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solana update on Fee Markets</a>,
all types of users on the Solana blockchain can utilise
<a href="https://docs.solana.com/proposals/fee_transaction_priority" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">priority fees</a> to
bid for priority for their transactions in the leader’s queue. In the recent FTX
situation, we’ve experienced an increased amount of users opting for prioritised
transactions — meaning they utilised priority fees in times of need. This lead
to non-prioritised transactions to not succeed timely.</p><p>Links to external sites to view recent trends of fees on Solana:<br>
<a href="https://beta-analysis.solscan.io/public/dashboard/06d689e1-dcd7-4175-a16a-efc074ad5ce2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solscan Fee Tracker</a><br>
<a href="https://dune.com/crypto_notte/solana-additional-fee-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dune Dashboard</a></p><p>Oracles remain a critical infrastructure for all types of products to execute
timely at any given scenario. Hence, in the event of an increased amount of
users opting for prioritised transactions, crucial data feeds on Switchboard
must participate as well — introducing <strong>Data Feed Priority Fees</strong>. Furthermore,
after researching, we’ve implemented a <strong>Sliding Window</strong> feature to improve
oracle success rates.</p><h1>Data Feed Priority Fees</h1><p>In order to maintain Switchboard’s permissionless and customisable aspect, we’ve
implemented priority fees to data feeds to be a user-configurable method.</p><p>In the User Profile page, users can now specify priority fees settings to
improve feed quality when feed is stale — meaning to increase priority fees in
order to land transactions for feed updates.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="refer-to-image-for-a-concise-description-of-each-setting">Refer to image for a concise description of each setting.<a href="#refer-to-image-for-a-concise-description-of-each-setting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Refer to image for a concise description of each setting." title="Direct link to Refer to image for a concise description of each setting.">​</a></h2><p>In this case, Staleness<!-- -->*<!-- --> refers to:</p><h1>Sliding Window</h1><p>In the standard Switchboard v2 architecture, it forces the reporting oracle to
only accept answers from a new single round. With Sliding Window, instead of
aforementioned, oracles will be able to accept last N answers regardless of
round ID.</p><p>This means that oracles are able to complete their tasks despite when a new
round opens.</p><p>The Sliding Window feature can also be found in the User Page configurations.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Ultimately, Switchboard users can now improve feed quality by opting for Data
Feed Priority Fees and enabling Sliding Window.</p><p>Inevitably, updates will happen to blockchains, we aim to maintain the
Switchboard protocol as we keep up to date with any relevant updates, providing
our users with the best experience — accurate and timely data in a
permissionless and customisable way.</p><p>If you have any queries, feel free to reach out!</p><p>Twitter:

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Building &amp; Managing Data Feeds through Multisig Solutions</p><p>Switchboard protocol provides a permissionless way to customize data feeds to
your specific use cases. Our approach has always been developer-first, allowing
developers to build feeds through our low-code interface, the
<a href="https://app.switchboard.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publisher</a> app and manage seamlessly all in the
same application.</p><p>As our ecosystem protocols grow and scale together with Switchboard, there will
be protocols that require a similar set of data feeds. Take example of a group
of DeFi protocol, they are likely integrating with similar crypto assets and
thus, requiring a similar set of price feeds to plug into their protocols.</p><p>In order for teams and developers to co-own data feeds in a secure manner, a
multi-signature (Multisig) wallet solution will be able to achieve it.</p><h1>Building and Managing Data Feeds through Multisig Solutions</h1><p>After receiving requests from mainly DeFi protocols, we’ve integrated with
Multisig solutions on Solana to bring this feature to our users. Switchboard
users are now able to utilise Multisigs to build, fund and manage their data
feeds with external parties.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="what-is-a-multisig">What is a Multisig?<a href="#what-is-a-multisig" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is a Multisig?" title="Direct link to What is a Multisig?">​</a></h2><p>A multi-signature wallet allows a group of users to approve a transaction before
it can be executed. Many individuals and teams desire to have multiple parties
sign off on a transaction, such as payments or withdrawals before it can be
executed. This allows for more robust security, as it spreads the responsibility
of your digital assets to multiple parties, and avoids a single point of failure
in the case of a compromised individual or wallet.</p><p>Multiple users can be required to manage any on-chain transaction, for example
requiring multiple users to sign a payment transaction, purchasing an NFT,
withdrawal from a wallet or in Switchboard’s use case: updating the settings and
funding of a data feed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="how-does-multisig-work-with-switchboard">How does Multisig work with Switchboard?<a href="#how-does-multisig-work-with-switchboard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does Multisig work with Switchboard?" title="Direct link to How does Multisig work with Switchboard?">​</a></h2><p>When creating a data feed, users can opt to integrate their data feeds with a
Multisig wallet. To do so, they will either need to:</p><ul><li>Create a feed through a Multisig wallet and have its authority immediately
under the Multisig wallet’s address upon creation;</li><li>Create a feed natively on Switchboard’s
<a href="https://app.switchboard.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publisher</a> and transfer its authority to a
Multisig wallet address (as shown in image).</li></ul><p>My Profile page in Switchboard Publisher</p><p>This integration allows multiple users in the Multisig to gain ownership of the
data feed and to execute transactions responsibly such as funding the lease of
the feed or updating the feed configurations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="benefits-of-using-switchboard-through-a-multisig-solution">Benefits of using Switchboard through a Multisig solution<a href="#benefits-of-using-switchboard-through-a-multisig-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Benefits of using Switchboard through a Multisig solution" title="Direct link to Benefits of using Switchboard through a Multisig solution">​</a></h2><p>Bringing back the example from above, a group of DeFi protocol can set up a
Multisig wallet to manage a group of price feeds that they require for their
protocols. By doing so, they can save on funds by sharing feeds, instead of
funding them individually. Since fees are shared amongst more parties, they can
opt for the best feed security by maximising the number of <em>jobResults</em> and
<em>oracleResults</em> for each feed.</p><p>The integration helps improve developer operations on the protocol side but
ultimately, the end users benefit greatly from this as well. The knowledge of
knowing that the protocols are using a set of price feeds controlled through a
Multisig wallet — provides an additional layer of security as responsibility and
cross-checking are heightened.</p><h1>To conclude</h1><p>Switchboard users are able to utilise Multisig applications to build, manage and

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><h1>Switchboard’s multi-chain expansion plan</h1></blockquote><p>At Switchboard, we believe the future of oracle protocols is to expand across
the ever-growing amount of blockchains — empowering any developer coming from
any background, touching first base on any codebase, blockchain and ecosystem.</p><blockquote><h1>Question: Which chain?</h1></blockquote><p>The very first inception of Switchboard protocol is built on top of the Rust
program language. We’ve seen the growing love for Rust in developers, and in
order to empower more developers building with Rust, it makes sense to expand
towards another R<em>ust-based</em> blockchain.</p><blockquote><h1>#PluggedintoNEAR</h1></blockquote><p>With that said, Switchboard Labs is excited to officially announce the expansion
of Switchboard protocol to <strong>NEAR</strong> blockchain!</p><blockquote><h1>What does Switchboard bring to the NEAR ecosystem?</h1></blockquote><p>Being a permissionless oracle protocol, Switchboard’s philosophy is to firstly
build a low-code UI that reduces friction for developers. Instead of going
through layers of contacts to spin up a generic data feed, on Switchboard’s
Publisher, a developer can build their own data feed within minutes and have
full customizability, management over their own feeds.</p><p>Apart from our core infrastructure products, by bringing our oracle
infrastructure to NEAR, we believe providing developer workshops to educate and
onboard new developers is of utmost importance. Ultimately, this will help
enhance current and future developers’ building experience on NEAR blockchain.</p><blockquote><h1>wen dev-net?</h1></blockquote><p>Switchboard Labs has been heads down to build out the very same
developer-friendly experience for NEAR developers.</p><p>Word on the street is: <strong>*<!-- -->The more “#PluggedintoNEAR” we receive, we just might
have a surprise during NEARCON</strong>.<!-- -->*</p><p>Join our community and build with Switchboard where you plug and play with
oracles!</p><p><em>It’ll be electrifying.</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5262/1*ToCEQBtSb7j9ICu0fJHlrQ.png" class="img_QIlm"></p>]]></content:encoded>

depending on your use cases and risk tolerance</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3200/1*mw9LjHRBP_O1ebxh9BhSqw.jpeg" class="img_QIlm"></p><p>Developers building real world applications for web3 rely on oracles to relay
and publish data on-chain. Oracles are not a one size fit all solution, in fact
redundancy should be used depending on your use cases and risk tolerance.
Switchboard’s goal is to generalize data feeds and leave it up to the developer
to configure and tune their data flow. Today’s article looks at how Switchboard
feeds differ from other providers, and how you can configure your data feed to
increase economic security.</p><p>We also have an infographic which summarizes this article:
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/img/Data_Feed_Best_Practices.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.switchboard.xyz/img/Data_Feed_Best_Practices.png</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="oracles-overview">Oracles Overview<a href="#oracles-overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Oracles Overview" title="Direct link to Oracles Overview">​</a></h2><p>A Switchboard feed belongs to a single oracle queue, which is a realm of oracles
that get assigned to update requests in a round-robin fashion. The feed’s config
dictates how update requests are invoked and routed through the network, along
with a set of job accounts that define how data is sourced off-chain.
Switchboard data feeds can fetch data from http endpoints, websockets, or
on-chain sources. Switchboard feeds are meant to be generic enough to meet any
use case and leave it up to the on-chain consumers to configure.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="oracle-consensus">Oracle Consensus<a href="#oracle-consensus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Oracle Consensus" title="Direct link to Oracle Consensus">​</a></h3><p>Switchboard uses rounds to open and close a batch of oracle responses. A
Switchboard feed has a specified <strong><em>minUpdateDelay</em></strong> which determines the
minimum time a round is open for in order to give the oracles enough time to
respond. When a new round is opened, the data feed gets assigned to a new batch
of oracles, which is configurable with the parameter
<strong><em>oracleRequestBatchSize</em></strong>. After <strong><em>minOracleResults</em></strong> responses are
received, the on-chain program calculates the result using the median of the
oracle responses. The median ensures large outliers do not drastically skew the
accepted result, unlike averages. Oracles who responded within the queue’s
configured parameters are rewarded, while the oracles who respond outside this
threshold are slashed (if the queue has slashingEnabled). As you can see, the
oracle consensus can be configured by the downstream user to provide the
security necessary for their use case. Check out the
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/feed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data feed docs</a> for more information on the
lifecycle of Switchboard data feed updates.</p><p>This differs from other oracle solutions like Pyth where data feeds are sourced
from trusted market participants directly. This results in a faster update rate
but makes no guarantees on the number of sources that responded. With
Switchboard feeds you can guarantee a set number of sources and oracles have
responded before accepting the result on-chain.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="democratizing-data-feeds">Democratizing Data Feeds<a href="#democratizing-data-feeds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Democratizing Data Feeds" title="Direct link to Democratizing Data Feeds">​</a></h2><p>Switchboard is a decentralized protocol that allows users to publish and request
updates from a pool of oracles. Switchboard oracles allocate their resources to
updates requested from on-chain consumers. This leaves it up to the consumer to
decide what data is brought on-chain.</p><p>Switchboard feeds are public meaning anyone is free to read the value on-chain
so sometimes it is ideal to piggy back on an existing feed. This works well for
some protocols but leaves you vulnerable to sudden changes in your on-chain data
flow. This is a risk vector that can be mitigated by owning your own data feed
and being your feed’s authority.</p><p>If you’re using a public data feed, consider contributing to the feeds lease to
extend its lifetime.</p><p>💡 <strong>NOTE</strong>: The feed authority differs from the lease authority. Only the lease
authority is permitted to withdraw funds. When contributing to public leases
check the lease authority is set to an empty public key or else the feed
authority could withdraw the funds for themselves.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="own-your-data">Own Your Data<a href="#own-your-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Own Your Data" title="Direct link to Own Your Data">​</a></h3><p>The feed authority has the power to modify the feed, including:</p><ul><li><p>change the job definitions and adapt to market conditions such as if a new
exchange siphoned volume from the current sources</p></li><li><p>speed up or slow down the feed depending on changing use cases</p></li><li><p>change the reporting parameters to save on cost</p></li><li><p>move the feed to a new queue for increased security or reliability</p></li><li><p>complete ownership over your on-chain data flow</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="dao">DAO<a href="#dao" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DAO" title="Direct link to DAO">​</a></h3><p>A feed authority could even be set to a DAO where the quorum votes on changes to
a feeds configuration. This is true decentralization at play where the settings
of a feed are optimized for a variety of use cases where voting power could be
controlled by lease contributions or tokens staked.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="tuning-a-switchboard-feed">Tuning a Switchboard Feed<a href="#tuning-a-switchboard-feed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tuning a Switchboard Feed" title="Direct link to Tuning a Switchboard Feed">​</a></h2><p>Now that we have some background on how switchboard oracles publish data
on-chain, let’s look at how to configure a Switchboard feed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="data-source-diversity">Data Source Diversity<a href="#data-source-diversity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Source Diversity" title="Direct link to Data Source Diversity">​</a></h3><p>The first step when building a feed is determining where you are sourcing your
data from. Each data source should correspond to a job account, which is just a
collection of <a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Switchboard tasks</a>, used
to instruct the oracles on how to fetch and transform data. Checkout the
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/feed/directory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job directory</a> for some example
definitions. You can also view a catalog of curated job definitions in the
<a href="https://app.switchboard.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Switchboard publisher</a>.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Job Diversity</strong> — Ensure you’re sourcing data from multiple, reliable
sources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Job Weights</strong> — Add job weights for sources with a higher degree of truth,
such as exchanges where price discovery is likely to happen. Oracles submit
the weighted median as their final result so jobs with a higher weight have
more influence on the result.</p></li><li><p><strong>minJobResults</strong> — Ensure the oracles have a reliable set of data before
responding on-chain. If only 1 out of 12 sources respond, you will not have a
reliable result. But if you set this to 12 out of 12 and one of your sources
is failing, you will encounter a stale feed, so ensure you have some margin
for single source failures.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="queue-selection">Queue Selection<a href="#queue-selection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Queue Selection" title="Direct link to Queue Selection">​</a></h3><p>You should select a queue that will provide your feed with a sufficient level of
security.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Oracle Reputation</strong> — you should select a queue with a proven track record
of honest reporting. Oracles store various
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/idl/types/OracleMetrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metrics</a> on-chain that
can be used to determine their reliability. Oracles are assigned to update
request in a round robin fashion where assignment is pseudo-random but this
gives a fairly accurate picture of a queues overall reliability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oracle minStake</strong> — you should select a queue that requires oracles to stake
a respectable sum of capital before joining the queue. This will be used to
slash oracles for misreporting feeds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Queue Reward</strong> — your selected queue should reward oracles sufficiently
enough such that they are incentivized to report honestly, yet not too high
where update request are prohibitively expensive. Switchboard DAO queues
currently use 12500 lamports as the oracle reward, per update request.</p></li><li><p><strong>Queue Permissions</strong> — high availability feeds should be on a queue where
<strong><em>unpermissionedFeedsEnabled</em></strong> is set to false. This prevents data feeds
from being able to join and spam the queue with update requests.</p></li><li><p><strong>Slashing</strong> — feeds securing financial applications should be on a queue with
<strong><em>slashingEnabled</em></strong> to dissuade oracles from malicious behavior.</p></li></ul><p>You may notice Switchboard DAO queues do not have all of these settings enabled
yet. Switchboard DAO queues currently rely on vetting trusted oracle operators
to bootstrap the network. As the network grows, the queues will be further
decentralized and rely on these parameters to enforce security. Stay tuned for
more information on the Switchboard DAO and how new oracles will be permitted by
the network.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="data-availability">Data Availability<a href="#data-availability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Availability" title="Direct link to Data Availability">​</a></h3><p>Configure when and how often you need new data on-chain.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Crank / Automatic Updates</strong> — any data feed that has sufficient queue
permissions is able to join a crank. A crank is a scheduling mechanism for
data feeds that will invoke a new round after each minUpdateDelay with some
added jitter to prevent predictable oracle assignment. Data feeds not on a
crank should set the option <strong><em>disableCrank</em></strong> and will need to manually
requests new updates or have their own scheduling mechanism.</p></li><li><p><strong>minUpdateDelay</strong> — determines how often new data can be requested on-chain.
This should be set depending on your use case. Decentralized exchanges will
need faster updates than a lending protocol.</p></li><li><p><strong>varianceThreshold</strong> — is the change percentage required between a previous
round and the current oracle result before a value is published on-chain. This
is used to conserve lease fees for the feed operator. Highly available feeds
should set this to 0 so values are always reported on-chain.</p></li><li><p><strong>forceReportPeriod</strong> — is the max staleness for a feed. If the
varianceThreshold was not exceeded but a set number of seconds have passed,
the oracle will respond on-chain. This should almost always be used with
varianceThreshold to ensure your feed is updating as expected and not stale
for another reason.</p></li></ul><p>💡 <strong>NOTE</strong>: See the
<a href="https://docs.rs/switchboard-v2/latest/switchboard_v2/aggregator/struct.AggregatorAccountData.html#method.check_staleness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check_staleness</a>
function in the rust crate when integrating.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="oracle-consensus-1">Oracle Consensus<a href="#oracle-consensus-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Oracle Consensus" title="Direct link to Oracle Consensus">​</a></h3><p>Configure how many oracles are assigned to a request and how many must respond
to accept a result.</p><ul><li><p><strong>oracleRequestBatchSize</strong> — sets the number of oracles assigned to each
update request. The quickest way to increase feed security is to request more
oracles each update round because it requires a higher degree of oracle
collusion in order to affect the on-chain result. In reality, this increases
the overall cost of a feed so it’s a careful consideration for feed operators
when configuring a feed.</p></li><li><p><strong>minOracleResults</strong> — set the minimum number of oracles that must respond
before accepting a result on-chain. This ensures you have a sufficient data
set before the on-chain program takes the median of the oracle responses.</p></li></ul><p>The number of oracles assigned to an update request should always be less than
the number of oracles required to respond. There are a variety of reasons that
may cause an oracle response to fail, such as Solana network degradation,
individual oracle network issues, or transaction spamming. Your feed’s lease is
only deducted when a round was successfully closed based on the feed’s
minOracleResults.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="cost">Cost<a href="#cost" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cost" title="Direct link to Cost">​</a></h3><p>The two main methods to reduce a feeds cost is to:</p><ul><li><p>increase the <strong><em>minUpdateDelay</em></strong> so updates are requested less often</p></li><li><p>add a <strong><em>varianceTolerance</em></strong> so changes are only reported when a given
percentage change threshold is reached. This will greatly reduce the number of
updates on-chain during periods of low volatility so if you are using a
staleness check in your on-chain program, make sure to pair it with
<strong><em>forceReportPeriod</em></strong> so a value is always reported after a given staleness
interval.</p></li></ul><p>Another way to reduce cost is to set the feed authority to a DAO and share the
feed cost with other on-chain consumers. A DAO can be used to vote on feed
changes and can help democratize data on-chain. If you’re using a public data
feed, consider contributing to the feeds lease to extend its lifetime.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="redundancy">Redundancy<a href="#redundancy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Redundancy" title="Direct link to Redundancy">​</a></h3><p>While Switchboard feeds have a proven track record, no system is fault tolerant
without some level of redundancy. If possible, you should pair a Switchboard
feed with another oracle provider or a TWAP feed to ensure you are viewing
reliable data. Stay tuned for a future article on advanced data feed usages.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="recommended-feed-configuration">Recommended Feed Configuration<a href="#recommended-feed-configuration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Recommended Feed Configuration" title="Direct link to Recommended Feed Configuration">​</a></h2><p>The following table highlights some recommended settings.

with a Switchboard feed.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Monitor Lease Funds</strong> — you should monitor your feeds lease account for low
balances. When a feed’s lease is emptied, it will no longer process new
updates until it has enough to reward the oracles processing the update. We
are working with a few web3 messaging services to enable wallet notifications
when leases are low on funds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitor Crank Eviction</strong> — if a lease is emptied, it will also be evicted
from its crank. Switchboard feeds act like public utilities where anyone is
free to re-push it to a crank, as long as it doesn’t have <strong>disableCrank</strong> set
to true.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitor Data Sources</strong> — Sometimes APIs change or move. High availability
feeds should have some basic routine health checks to ensure their on-chain
data is updating as expected.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="integration-checklist">Integration Checklist<a href="#integration-checklist" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Integration Checklist" title="Direct link to Integration Checklist">​</a></h2><p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/switchboard-v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">switchboard-v2</a> crate is used to

This
will automatically store the last <strong>N</strong> accepted results on-chain, where N is
configurable by the user from 1 to 350,000 samples, with the current Solana
account size limits. On-chain consumers can also read from the history buffer
and validate a subset of the history to ensure the current oracle price has not
skewed too far from the recent samples.</p><p>Once a feed has a history buffer, anyone can create a separate TWAP feed that
reads the history buffer and calculates the time weighted average. This is
useful for feeds that may have low liquidity and suffer from frequent price
swings.</p><p>More advanced usages of TWAP include the ability to source the TWAP price at
settlement each week. Let us say we’re an options protocol with contracts
settling at 5PM UTC every Friday and we need a way to source the 1hr TWAP
leading up to settlement. We also need to ensure that value is always calculated
for that 1hr window so our liquidators are using the most accurate price
observed on-chain. With Switchboard, you can build a feed that will always
resolve to that 1hr window each week. You can see it in action here on devnet.

If you require a more complicated data feed, do not hesitate to reach out
because we may be able to build a custom solution that will benefit not only you
but other data feed users.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="feed-creation-walkthrough">Feed Creation Walkthrough<a href="#feed-creation-walkthrough" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Feed Creation Walkthrough" title="Direct link to Feed Creation Walkthrough">​</a></h2><p>I’m a brand new lending protocol and I need a new data feed for XYZ. Let’s walk
through some considerations I might have for how to publish this feed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="queue-selection-1">Queue Selection<a href="#queue-selection-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Queue Selection" title="Direct link to Queue Selection">​</a></h3><p>This protocol will obviously be successful and have a significant total value
locked (TVL) so I should choose a secure queue. I look at a queue that already
has an XYZ feed but I notice the queue isn’t as secure as I need; maybe it has a
low minimum stake requirement for oracles or doesn’t slash oracles for
misreporting. So I check the Switchboard DAO and find a queue that requires
oracles to stake 10 SOL, has slashing enabled, requires feeds to be permitted to
join, and has a proven track record of honest reporting … perfect, we found the
queue we’ll create the feed for.</p><p>💡 <strong>NOTE</strong>: Data feed owners can always move their feed to a new queue after
creation.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="data-source-diversity-1">Data Source Diversity<a href="#data-source-diversity-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Source Diversity" title="Direct link to Data Source Diversity">​</a></h3><p>Next, we’ll need to find where to source the data. I see 4 centralized exchanges
and 2 decentralized exchanges. Upon further inspection, I notice one of the CEXs
has questionable volume and one of the DEXs has no volume — so we should ignore
these sources. So we’ll create the feed with 3 CEXs and 1 DEX. This is good but
let’s see if we can do better. We see theres a Saber pool for this asset so we
can use the
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#lpexchangeratetask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lpExchangeRateTask</a>
to fetch the price. We can also use the
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#jupiterswaptask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jupiterSwapTask</a> to
aggregate through various on-chain sources and get us the best price. Awesome,
we have 3 CEXs, 1 DEX, a Saber pool source, and a Jupiter Swap source.</p><p>We want the feed result to be calculated with enough sources so we have an
accurate depiction of the price but if we keep it too strict, a single source
failing could halt the feed — maybe one of the CEX sources had a data center
outage. Your <strong>minJobResults</strong> should be at least one less than the total number
of sources to account for this. To give us enough margin, we’ll set ours to 4,
so 4 out of 6 sources have to respond in order for the oracle to publish a price
update.</p><p>We notice the majority of the volume for this source is on a single CEX where
the majority of price discovery occurs — we should definitely weigh this source
higher than the rest. Here’s what that may look like.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*2rrHzP2TjiKlpr9p7dMDEw.png" class="img_QIlm"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="data-availability-1">Data Availability<a href="#data-availability-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Availability" title="Direct link to Data Availability">​</a></h3><p>A lending protocol may not need the most up-to-date prices as compared to a
trading platform. So we will set the <strong>minUpdateDelaySeconds</strong> to 15. This
should be fast enough for our lending platform — we can always adjust if needed.</p><p>We’re a lending protocol on-chain so we need the data to be readily available —
so we will choose to push the feed onto a crank to enable automatic updates. The
crank is an incentivisation mechanism to regularly schedule feed updates. A
sport betting platform may opt-out of a crank since they will only need the data
when an event is settled.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="oracle-consensus-2">Oracle Consensus<a href="#oracle-consensus-2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Oracle Consensus" title="Direct link to Oracle Consensus">​</a></h3><p>We’re planning on securing financial capital with our data feeds so we need to
ensure a malicious oracle cannot skew the price feed in its favor. To do this we
will set the <strong>oracleRequestBatchSize</strong> to at least 8. This means 5+ oracles
would have to collude in order to skew a feeds accepted value on-chain; remember
we’re using the median and not the average as the final result. We’ll then set
<strong>minOracleResults</strong> to 7 to account for any oracle networking issues that may
prevent them from responding. If only 7 oracles respond, at least 4 will need to
be acting in good faith to produce an honest result — which is a very reasonable
assumption to make since we selected our queue carefully.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="cost-1">Cost<a href="#cost-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cost" title="Direct link to Cost">​</a></h3><p>Woohoo, we’re almost done. We’ve built the job definitions, configured and tuned
the settings, so we head over to the Switchboard publisher to build the feed. We
get to checkout and notice the cost may be a bit high for a lending protocol
that is just starting out. No worries, let’s look at some ways to conserve cost.</p><p>Let’s look at <strong>minUpdateDelaySeconds.</strong> Updating this feed every 15 seconds may
be a bit overkill. We can increase this to 30 to double the length of the feed.</p><p>The XYZ feed is a relatively low volatility feed, meaning the prices updated
on-chain may be the same or about the same each update round. To account for
this we can set the <strong>varianceThreshold</strong> to 0.1%, which instructs the oracles
to skip reporting a value if the value hasn’t differed by 0.1% since the last
reported value on-chain. This will greatly extend the life of your feed but
makes it hard to estimate the length of time left on the feed since it will
depend on the feeds volatility and market conditions. Our feed will now only
incur a cost when a feeds value has changed significantly.</p><p>Great, we’ve found some ways to reduce cost without sacrificing security. But
what if the XYZ asset suffers some loss of interest and reduce volatility? Your
feed may fail to update for hours on end if the price hasn’t moved by the set
varianceThreshold. This can be mitigated by setting a <strong>forceReportPeriod</strong>,
which instructs the oracles to always report a result on-chain even if the
variance threshold wasn’t exceeded, or max staleness. We will set
<strong>forceReportPeriod</strong> to 900 so the feed will always report a value on-chain
every 15minutes. When integrating on-chain, we should always be checking if the
feed was updated within the forceReportPeriod interval to ensure the feed is
healthy.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>This was just a basic overview of how to think about configuring a feed to meet
your use case. Each on-chain application will have their own set of requirements
for how often a feed needs to be updated and what level of security is needed.
Switchboard has provided the tools to generalize feed creation to meet most
developers use cases. Please stop by the Discord with any questions on
configuring or integrating Switchboard feeds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Switchboard continues to be the only provider for verifiable randomness (VRF) on
Solana and today we are excited to announce a fee reduction bringing the overall
cost of a VRF request down to just under <strong>0.002 SOL</strong> — a 50x reduction!</p><p>Initially, Switchboard set the cost of a VRF request to 0.1 SOL to protect the
oracles from being overwhelmed with VRF requests, which could potentially crash
the oracles as they awaited the VRF proof to confirm. Switchboard oracles have
since migrated to using nonce accounts, or non-expiring transactions, to submit
the necessary proofs, reducing the oracle’s memory footprint, and increasing the
overall reliability of successfully completing the VRF proof. See the twitter
thread below for more information.</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/6382c1a58c85f5921801b98283752f32" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>Switchboard will continue listening to the developer ecosystem in order to help
power the next wave of projects on Solana. If you’re a developer that is
integrating randomness into your application, we would love to connect and see
how it can be further improved.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="what-is-randomness">What is Randomness?<a href="#what-is-randomness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Randomness?" title="Direct link to What is Randomness?">​</a></h2><p>Random numbers are a useful building block for many applications, such as gaming
and some consensus protocols. Without an element of randomness, games and
protocols can be cheated when adversaries are able to influence the outcome.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7abFvsyHSLd4qos2ANkGiw.jpeg" class="img_QIlm"></p><p>While true-randomness on some computers can be made possible via <em>atmospheric
noise</em> and special hardware modules, such solutions on blockchains are not
possible since they are <em>virtual machines </em>without physical hardware. Thus,
pseudorandom-functions are needed to close this gap.</p><p>Enter Verifiable Random Function (VRF). A VRF is a public-key pseudorandom
function that provides proofs that its outputs were calculated correctly. This
means we can use a cryptographic keypair to generate a random number with a
proof, which can then be validated by anyone to ensure the value was calculated
correctly without the possibility of leaking the producer’s secret key. You can
read more about
<a href="https://medium.com/algorand/algorand-releases-first-open-source-code-of-verifiable-random-function-93c2960abd61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VRF from the Algorand team</a>,
whose founder was one of the authors on the original VRF paper.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="is-switchboard-vrf-secure">Is Switchboard VRF Secure?<a href="#is-switchboard-vrf-secure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Is Switchboard VRF Secure?" title="Direct link to Is Switchboard VRF Secure?">​</a></h2><p>Switchboard’s implementation adheres to volume 11 of the Internet Research Task
Force’s (IRTFs) draft for VRF. If you like math feel free to check it out
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Once the oracle has posted the proof on-chain, anyone is permitted to turn the
crank and verify the proof. If a malicious oracle tries to submit a false proof,
it will be rejected on-chain during the proof verification.</p><p>Switchboard’s VRF implementation uses the VRF counter and the recent blockhash
as the VRF input to prevent oracles from gaining an unfair advantage.
Unfortunately, this means that just like any other blockchain VRF protocol,
there exists a collusion vector between the oracle and the block-producer,
however, it is much more secure than simply using the blockhash on its own on
its own for randomness!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="should-i-use-xyz-for-randomness">Should I use XYZ for Randomness?<a href="#should-i-use-xyz-for-randomness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Should I use XYZ for Randomness?" title="Direct link to Should I use XYZ for Randomness?">​</a></h2><p>Many projects attempt to derive “randomness” from the latest blockhash.
Unfortunately, while very low-cost, this is <strong><em>extremely insecure</em></strong> against an
adversary with the ability to influence transaction ordering. Slot leaders could
easily exploit your game or protocol by adding noise to the blocks they produce
to result in “random” data favorable to themselves. With the advent of MEV tech
such as Flashbots, Jito Labs, and proposer-builder-separation, this attack
vector may become more accessible to unsophisticated adversaries.</p><p>Another risk to be aware of is improper VRFs, such as those based on
non-deterministic signature schemes, like EdDSA. See

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since inception, Switchboard was built with a primary goal in mind: democratize
data feeds such that any developer can build, configure, and own their data
on-chain. By enabling developers and lowering the barrier of entry for bringing
data on-chain, we will help foster the next wave of applications for Web 3.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="background">Background<a href="#background" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Background" title="Direct link to Background">​</a></h2><p>Blockchains cannot communicate with Web 2 services and need an intermediary to
facilitate this exchange. Solana programs need an oracle service to fetch and
pre-populate the data on-chain before it can be used by a program. A fault
tolerant data feed should have multiple off-chain sources defined, which can be
time consuming for developers to seek out and configure.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="publisher">Publisher<a href="#publisher" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Publisher" title="Direct link to Publisher">​</a></h2><p>Enter the <a href="http://app.switchboard.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publisher</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*FQRpo7lrJ49Txu5AZ__YRA.gif" alt="app.switchboard.xyz" class="img_QIlm"><em>app.switchboard.xyz</em></p><p>The Publisher is a decentralized data catalog, giving data feed publishers
(typically developers) a convenient interface to find and build data feeds. The

<em>Feed Builder</em> to build and test custom job definitions in a simple to use
drag-n-drop interface. After a publisher has created their feeds on-chain, they
can monitor and fund their data feed on the <em>My Feeds</em> dashboard.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5760/1*nTdLwGvSCFbztAx7qgkdOA.png" alt="Drag-n-drop interface" class="img_QIlm"><em>Drag-n-drop

everyone we met at the Solana hacker house. The speed at which this developer
ecosystem is growing can only be witnessed in person.</p><p>And also thank you to all of the Riptide hackathon submissions that were built
with Switchboard. It was an impressive lineup and we’re excited to see how they
grow within the Solana ecosystem.</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/9d5f54a40ec0574b4800b1d0ae78185c" frameborder="0"></iframe><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="anchor-fetch">Anchor Fetch<a href="#anchor-fetch" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Anchor Fetch" title="Direct link to Anchor Fetch">​</a></h2><p>Project Serum’s Anchor framework provides a common Interface Design Language
(IDL) which specifies how programs written in Anchor store data on-chain and
serialize instructions. The IDL gives developers a quick way to hook into
programs without needing to integrate the program’s specific API. In fact, you
can view any Anchor program account using the Solana explorer and visually view
the on-chain data.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Switchboard V2 is written in Anchor and you can view its IDL at

with its newly added
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#anchorfetchtask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AnchorFetchTask</a>. The
publisher specifies the program ID and account address, and the Switchboard
oracle will return the JSON representation of the parsed account data. This can
then be chained with a
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#jsonparsetask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JsonParseTask</a> to return
a single value from any Anchor account. This new feature allows developers to
build complex oracles based on any Anchor account field.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="defi-kingdoms">Defi Kingdoms<a href="#defi-kingdoms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Defi Kingdoms" title="Direct link to Defi Kingdoms">​</a></h2><p>Switchboard has also added the
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#defikingdomtask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DefiKingdomsTask</a> to
allow publishers to build data feeds that return the swap price of a token on
DeFi Kingdoms. DeFi Kingdoms is a DeFi game built on ETH with in-game tokens and
NFTs that players can trade.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>Oracles will need to update to

<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/architecture/feeds#aggregatoraccountdata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">varianceThreshold</a>
dictates the change percentage required before an oracle reports a result
on-chain. A Switchboard data feed includes a pre-funded escrow to reward oracles
for each successful update. The varianceThreshold is a cost saving parameter to
reduce excessive on-chain updates and extend the life of a feed. If an oracle
resolves a value that is too similar to the last reported value, the oracle
skips reporting a result and conserves the feed’s escrow. Note, some feeds may
require the most up-to-date data so it is left up to the publisher based on
their use case.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*uwaHVEVzPbH26MQe" alt="Switchboard Lease Configuration" class="img_QIlm"><em>Switchboard

<a href="https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api#/default/gridpoint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">api.weather.gov/gridpoints</a>
endpoint to resolve our data feed. After doing some digging we’ve determined
that the weather forecast office should be <strong>MFL</strong> and the latitude and
longitude should be 111 and 50 respectively. So our full API endpoint should be
<a href="https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MFL/111,50/forecast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MFL/111,50/forecast</a>.

is a great resource to test your queries. After some trial and error we’ve
determined that the JSON path query should be
“$.properties.periods.0.temperature”. This will access the first array element
in the properties.periods object and return that period’s temperature. So now
we’ve figured out how to fetch the weather data and extract the latest
temperature value.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="build-task-definitions">Build Task Definitions<a href="#build-task-definitions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Build Task Definitions" title="Direct link to Build Task Definitions">​</a></h3><p>Now we can put it all together.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>| TWAP! TWAP! TWAP! Switchboard V2 now supports aggregator history</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="what-is-twap">What is TWAP?<a href="#what-is-twap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is TWAP?" title="Direct link to What is TWAP?">​</a></h3><p>A time weighted average price (TWAP) is the average price of an asset over a
specified time frame. Let’s say you’re a large trader and you want to enter a
large SOL/USD position. If you execute a sudden market order, you could drain
the order book and end up paying substantially more for the trade, plus bots
will immediately start to arbitrage and your position will be underwater
immediately. If you execute the same position using a TWAP, your orders will be
spread throughout the given timeframe, allowing the market to absorb your
liquidity, and giving you a more optimal price of the true market value.</p><p>TWAP use cases extend beyond just trading. Here are just a few examples of how a
TWAP could be used in DeFi to reduce oracle price manipulations:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Funding Premiums:</strong> Using a TWAP over a random sample to avoid a single
sample skewing the results</p></li><li><p><strong>Futures Expiry:</strong> Futures expiration are correlated with higher volatility.
Using a TWAP reduces the risk of manipulation or

position liquidations.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-Chain Trading Algos:</strong> An on-chain program could use a Switchboard TWAP
oracle to execute positions on Serum based on a given criteria.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="how-to-use-twaptask">How to Use TwapTask?<a href="#how-to-use-twaptask" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Use TwapTask?" title="Direct link to How to Use TwapTask?">​</a></h3><p>To start using the new TwapTask with Switchboard V2, you will need to initialize
a history buffer account for your aggregator. You can initialize a history
buffer using the
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/switchboardv2-api/classes/AggregatorAccount#sethistorybuffer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">javascript API method setHistoryBuffer</a>.
A history buffer account stores a set number of accepted results for an
aggregator, and given Solana’s maximum account size of 10MB, the maximum number
of samples a single history buffer can support is 350,000 samples (Keep in mind
rent cost, this action is currently irreversible). The screenshot below shows
the
<a href="https://switchboard.xyz/explorer/3/GvDMxPzN1sCj7L26YDK2HnMRXEQmQ2aemov8YBtPS7vR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOL/USD feed</a>’s
price history in action on our explorer page.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2022-02-07-Switchboard-Introduces-TWAP-Support_HistoryGraph-4cb6fae21f9cb5a36bd8c15295c4259c.png" width="1003" height="346" class="img_QIlm"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2022-02-07-Switchboard-Introduces-TWAP-Support_AggregatorCard-ce323cb719b21a0d82703fa5b5be6257.png" width="1059" height="845" class="img_QIlm"></p><p>Once a history buffer has been initialized for an aggregator, you can create a
separate aggregator to track its TWAP. You can have multiple TwapTask tied to a
single aggregator/history buffer. The
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/api/tasks#-twaptask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TwapTask</a> accepts the
following values:</p><ul><li><p><strong><em>aggregatorPubkey</em></strong>: The public key of the aggregator that has a history
buffer initialized</p></li><li><p><strong><em>period</em></strong>: The time period, in seconds, to include in the TWAP calculation</p></li><li><p><strong><em>weightByPropagationTime</em></strong> (Optional): Return the average, weighing each
sample by the sample’s propagation time (currentTimestamp —
previousTimestamp).</p></li><li><p><strong><em>minSamples</em></strong> (Optional): The minimum number of samples that must be
present in the history buffer, after filtering by time period, before
accepting a result</p></li></ul><p>The TwapTask first filters the history buffer and excludes any samples failing
outside the set time period. If the minSamples field is set and the number of
samples in the filtered list is less than the minSamples, the oracles will not
report a result. The oracle will then calculate the final value by taking the
weighted average between each sample’s interval. You can find an example of the
TwapTask in our
<a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/job-directory#twap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Job Directory</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="known-limitations">Known Limitations<a href="#known-limitations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Known Limitations" title="Direct link to Known Limitations">​</a></h3><p>The TwapTask relies on accepted on-chain results being pushed to the history
buffer. During periods of network degradations, aggregators may fail to post
accepted results due to an insufficient number of oracle responses. This may
cause TWAP calculations to have insufficient data to make a proper calculation.
To mitigate this, you should specify a minSamples field in the job definition to
only accept a TWAP result if enough samples are provided.</p><p>Check out our docs for a full list of tasks Switchboard supports:

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Switchboard V2 is the first permissionless oracle protocol live on Solana
mainnet!</p></blockquote><p>When we set out to build Switchboard the goal was clear: provide permissionless
data on Solana such that anyone can contribute and grow the network. Existing
oracle solutions rely on whitelisting oracle operators and building custom
solutions for new data feeds. We decided to take a much more scalable approach;
anyone is free to publish any data feed they wish on-chain and, provided they
meet the proper stake requirements, are free to run an oracle as well. Oracles
are awarded each time they complete an update request and slashed when they
provide incorrect results. This fits in line with the broader web3 vision and …</p><p><strong>Today we are happy to announce the launch of Switchboard V2!</strong></p><p>Switchboard V2 was rebuilt from the ground up using Project Serum’s Anchor
framework and is the first oracle network on Solana that allows permissionless
data feeds. To achieve this, we designed a publisher site that streamlines the
on-chain workflow and lets developers build and deploy a data feed in under 60
seconds. The publisher site is the culmination of months of working with some of
the top Solana projects, anticipating their needs, in order to provide the best
experience to support the thriving developer ecosystem. We can’t wait to see
what products come out of the next hackathon now that the data developers rely
on when building smart contracts is right at their fingertips.</p><p><strong>The publisher site is now live:</strong>

data in under 60 seconds!</em></p><p>Switchboard V2 introduces the concept of an oracle queue (realm) to manage how
oracle resources get allocated, a crank to jump start the system and find data
feeds ready for updates, and permission accounts to control who has access to an
oracle queue or other onchain resources. We are currently laying the foundation
for the Switchboard DAO so an oracle queue can be entirely managed by a DAO.
Initially the DAO quorum will consist of oracle operators as they are the most
familiar with the network constraints to make informed decisions but soon after
we will open up the DAO to anyone growing the Switchboard protocol with us. This
will make Switchboard the most decentralized oracle network in crypto.</p><p>We are excited to finally release the next iteration of our oracle protocol and
look forward to seeing what you build with it!</p><p><strong>Learn More</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://docs.switchboard.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs.switchboard.xyz</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/HCzKP4cHDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discord.com/invite/HCzKP4cHDT</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/switchboardxyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitter.com/switchboardxyz</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://t.me/switchboardxyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">t.me/switchboardxyz</a></p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

facilitate decentralized trading, lending, and many more functions <!-- -->[1]<!-- -->. With
DeFi we are able to deposit assets into an LP pool, receive yield bearing LP
tokens, and then borrow against our LP tokens. The price of these LP tokens is
typically calculated by summing the total liquidity in the pool and dividing by
the number of LP tokens issued. This basic calculation works well when the total
liquidity in the pool is balanced between each asset but starts to fall apart
when the pool liquidity is imbalanced.</p><p>Consider the WarpFinance incident where an attacker was able to use a flash loan
to manipulate the price of an LP token by taking advantage of the imbalance, for
which they used as collateral to borrow a greater amount of capital than was
sufficiently allowed <!-- -->[2]<!-- -->. This type of hack takes advantage of the LP token

member.</p><p>The fair LP formula takes into account the weight of each pool member’s
liquidity to determine a fair price. What that means is as a pool imbalance
grows, the price of the LP token decreases in order to lower the risk of flash
loan attacks being able to over-borrow against them.</p><p>Switchboard oracles now give you the option to calculate the fair price of an LP
token using the

Switchboard’s solution requires an existing aggregator for each pool member so
that the formula is always using the previous aggregator result for each pool
member’s price to prevent additional manipulation.</p><p>These feeds are live now so check out our feed explorer for an example of what

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When designing a decentralized protocol, it’s not enough to ensure your code is
well tested — you must also align the various parties so no single entity can
game the system. Today’s article will walk through the design of Switchboard V2
and how incentives are aligned to minimize trust in the protocol. Check out some
of our past articles for more background on Switchboard, and how it works.</p><p>Incentives are mechanisms to influence an individual or group to behave in a
certain manner. For example, tax cuts are a government incentive that reduces an
entity’s operating cost to promote spending. Similarly, many food delivery
companies subsidize delivery fees to capture future market share. These are all
extrinsic incentives because you expect some kind of reward for your actions.
Extrinsic incentives can only get you so far; eventually the food delivery
companies will need to turn a profit. Decentralized projects cannot operate in
the same manner as traditional companies where a single group can make the
decision to sacrifice profit for future market share. Instead the incentives
must be baked into the protocol and be known to all parties up front.</p><p>Switchboard was created to level the playing field and provide equal access to
on-chain data which allows anyone to suggest, approve, and update feeds. We hope
the community will be intrinsically motivated to support this vision and
actively participate to bring this to fruition. Switchboard will never whitelist
participants and will rely on the community to make improvements as the network
matures. The following paragraphs detail how Switchboard is designed and how the
community is able to tweak the protocol to align everyone’s incentives.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="governance">Governance<a href="#governance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Governance" title="Direct link to Governance">​</a></h2><p>Let’s begin with the governance system. Switchboard is governed by its
stakeholders via a democratic DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).
Switchboard participants are free to propose changes that fall into two
categories: Protocol proposals and Queue proposals.</p><p>Protocol proposals impact the overall architecture of Switchboard and have
deeper impacts on the network. An example of this might be increasing the number
of oracles a single queue can support or upgrading the on-chain program to add
additional features requested by the community. Protocol proposals impact all
queues on the network so changes should be carefully laid out and discussed
before reaching consensus.</p><p>Queue proposals impact a single oracle queue and can change various queue
parameters to help reach equilibrium between oracles and data feed updates. Some
of these parameters include:</p><ul><li><p>Minimum stake required for an Oracle to join the queue</p></li><li><p>Criteria for a data feed to be automatically approved to use the queue</p></li><li><p>Admitting additional data feeds to use the queue’s Oracle resources</p></li><li><p>Slashing rates for misbehaving Oracles</p></li></ul><p>Giving the users of the protocol a stake in the network (“skin in the game”)
aligns their incentives toward a common goal: providing permission-less on-chain
data for smart contract developers to reliably build upon. It is <strong>NOT</strong> in the
best interest of the switchboard community to implement changes that could
weaken the protocol or allow oracles to report dishonest data. Therefore it is
up to the community to remain an active participant and propose improvements
that align with the common goal and keep all parties happy.</p><p>Upon the launch of V2, the Switchboard DAO will provide at least three oracle
queues with varying levels of security based on the publisher’s needs.
Switchboard is a permission-less network so anyone can spin up their own Oracle
queues and control these parameters themselves. This is especially useful for
projects needing data from private endpoints or projects needing more
centralized control over their data. The rest of this article will be focused on
the Switchboard DAO and how oracle queues will be managed by the community.</p><p>Initially, the Switchboard DAO quorum will consist of oracle operators as they
are the most familiar with the protocol constraints. There is no shortage of
potential data feeds that developers want on-chain, so it’s the number of
oracles that will be the limiting factor as the network scales in the early
days. Oracle operators are best positioned to evaluate the impact of new feeds
and how it may impact their oracle’s performance or how changing oracle rewards
may entice their peers to game the system. It is important to keep the initial
quorum smaller in the early days of the network as it allows changes to be
implemented faster. Future DAO proposals will expand the DAO and include the
other network participants.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="incentives">Incentives<a href="#incentives" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Incentives" title="Direct link to Incentives">​</a></h2><p>Switchboard at its fundamental level is a data provider for smart contracts.
Developers expect to receive a single result that is sourced from multiple
endpoints, confirmed by multiple oracles, and updated at a set interval. The
publisher is usually an on-chain consumer of the data so they are responsible
for setting the data feed configuration up-front to meet their use cases. The
following paragraphs detail how the Switchboard protocol leverages incentives to
give developers more confidence in the final oracle result.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="job-diversity">Job Diversity<a href="#job-diversity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Job Diversity" title="Direct link to Job Diversity">​</a></h3><p>As we are all too familiar with, the classical web lacks redundancy meaning a
single network failure can crash an entire corporation, as we saw with Facebook
a few weeks ago. This is not a concern for blockchains but being as Switchboard
is the gateway between the two, it is up to the protocol to mitigate any outside
network disruptions. To deal with potential data sources being unreachable,
Switchboard incentivizes Curators to scour the internet and find redundant data
sources. Switchboard will provide the initial, open source reference
implementation that will allow anyone to submit potential data sources into a
registry for the Publishers to aggregate and build data feeds from. In return,
curators are rewarded with a percentage of the fees generated from a data feed.
The goal is to give everyone a role in the network and reward them for improving
the integrity of the network. When building a data feed, publishers can also
specify the minimum number of endpoints that must respond before accepting a
result. This flexibility gives the publisher more control over how a result is
derived and gives them more confidence in the protocol.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="rate-limiting">Rate Limiting<a href="#rate-limiting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rate Limiting" title="Direct link to Rate Limiting">​</a></h3><p>Requested data feed updates will often be hitting the same endpoint fairly
frequently (e.g. FTX.com). To mitigate rate limiting, some level of
pseudo-randomness jitter is introduced to the feed scheduler to prevent requests
hitting the same endpoint at the exact configured update interval. This helps
the network optimize for the lowest queries per second (QPS) and distributes
external requests more efficiently.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="approving-new-feeds">Approving New Feeds<a href="#approving-new-feeds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Approving New Feeds" title="Direct link to Approving New Feeds">​</a></h3><p>Data feeds are added to the network by either a DAO vote or having a
sufficiently long enough update interval. The update interval threshold is set
by the DAO and ensures new feeds joining the network can only consume a finite
amount of oracle resources in a set timeframe.</p><p>Publishers are responsible for funding a lease contract which provides the
upfront capital to reward oracle operators for processing their scheduled
updates. This up-front capital incentivizes publishers to only publish feeds
that are worthwhile and provide them some kind of value. A publisher is free to
propose any feed and eat the capital cost, as long as the oracles are rewarded
for their work. The lease contract amount is proportional to the length a
publisher expects to receive updates, the number of oracles processing a given
feed update, as well as the oracle rewards set by the DAO. Oracle rewards are an
upfront agreement between the publisher and oracle operators and should remain
static, at least in the initial DAO quorum where oracle operators could collude
to raise prices. Publishers are free to choose a queue with a lower cost but
they may be sacrificing security so it’s up to the publishers to find the right
balance.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="extraneous-feeds">Extraneous Feeds<a href="#extraneous-feeds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Extraneous Feeds" title="Direct link to Extraneous Feeds">​</a></h3><p>There may be a need for multiple data feeds resolving the same value but needing
different configurations depending on the publisher’s use case. For instance,
one feed may need a higher fidelity of confidence requiring a greater number of
oracle and job responses to dictate a final result, which in turn requires a
higher up-front capital cost for the publisher and could cause slower updates in
the event the set number of jobs fail to respond. Another feed may just need the
closest approximation as fast as possible. Switchboard’s flexibility gives
publishers a wide array of options to control how a value gets derived but like
all products, a publisher’s use case may change over time. In this event, a
publisher may elect to extend another publisher’s lease and spread the capital
cost to multiple on-chain consumers. This results in the feeds with the most use
having the lowest capital cost to the on-chain consumers. This also further
incentivizes curators to find resilient endpoints that get used frequently. This
positive feedback loop creates an environment where the strongest feeds get
extended and the remaining fall off the stack.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="oracle-incentives">Oracle Incentives<a href="#oracle-incentives" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Oracle Incentives" title="Direct link to Oracle Incentives">​</a></h3><p>Switchboard is an open network allowing anyone to run an oracle but there are
many reasons an oracle may be incentivized to game the system. For example, if
we know a smart contract is using a particular feed to calculate a collateral
ratio, an oracle could under-report the asset price and cause a liquidation or
cause someone to not get the fair market rate for a trade. There’s a myriad of
reasons an oracle could try and cheat so careful consideration was given to
incentivize honest oracle behavior.</p><p>Oracles are required to stake the set amount of capital specified by the Queue’s
DAO, which acts as an insurance policy to entice oracle operators to report
honest results. Each oracle queue can have different staking requirements to
influence its security. If the staking requirement is set too low it could
attract dishonest oracles, but if set too high oracles may find a better use of
their capital elsewhere.</p><p>An oracle’s reward for a given round is determined by how many oracles respond
and the oracles response compared to the accepted, median result. Oracles are
rewarded each time they submit a result and then reevaluated when an accepted
result has been accepted.</p><p>When a result has been accepted, the oracle rewards are redistributed to the
oracles that responded within the acceptable range. The median result filters
the outliers and means an attacker needs to control the majority of the assigned
oracles in order to skew a result. This is why increasing the oracle stake
requirements increases the security of the network because the attacker will
need more up-front capital to fund the attack. Oracle’s get assigned to data
feeds in a round robin fashion with feeds scheduled at varying intervals and
oracle amounts so even if an attacker controls 10% of the oracles, there is no
guarantee their oracles will get assigned to the same feed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="slashing">Slashing<a href="#slashing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Slashing" title="Direct link to Slashing">​</a></h3><p>After the on-chain contract has accepted a result, it rewards the oracles who
responded within the acceptable range, which is set when the queue is
initialized. Any oracle who responded outside the acceptable range will be
slashed and lose a portion of their staked capital. The slashing amount can be
changed by the DAO to further incentivize honest oracle behavior.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>Switchboard was designed to let the community dictate the protocol parameters at
the protocol and oracle queue level to meet any developers use case. Stay tuned

            <pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a previous article we looked at the different stakeholders and how they
operate within Switchboard V2. Today’s article will focus on the technical
components and how they interact with each other. So let’s jump right in.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="overview">Overview<a href="#overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overview" title="Direct link to Overview">​</a></h2><p><strong><em>What is a Data Feed?</em></strong></p><p>A data feed is the centerpiece of Switchboard and is what on-chain developers
will use when building smart contracts. A data feed is a collection of jobs that
get aggregated to produce some deterministic result. Each job is associated with
an endpoint and has a number of tasks that get executed in sequential order in
order to produce a single value. Typically the first task in a job will fetch
external data with subsequent tasks responsible for parsing the response and
transforming the value into a single data type, like an integer or decimal. When
an oracle is assigned to process a data feed update, the oracle executes the
defined jobs and publishes the median result on-chain. The data feed then
computes the final value as the median response among the assigned oracles. In
summary, the data feed is the blueprint for how data gets fetched from off-chain
sources.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2021-10-12-Switchboard-V2-Architecture-and-Data-Flows_FeedComposition-7e5049ec91c3b3eca31427777fe32560.jpg" width="1652" height="1024" class="img_QIlm"></p><p>Along with the jobs, a data feed also includes a configuration dictating how
often a feed should be updated and the minimum number of jobs or oracles that
must respond before accepting a result. The publisher is ultimately responsible
for building a data feed and making the necessary trade-offs as it’s a careful
balance between cost and update interval. The publisher is usually the on-chain
consumer of the data and will have the most familiarity with how the data may be
used to make these considerations.</p><p><strong><em>Types of Data Feeds</em></strong></p><p>Once a data feed has been configured, it needs to be assigned an oracle queue to
process updates. Data feeds can be public, where they are approved by the DAO
and have access to its oracle queue, or private, where the publisher has their
own oracle infrastructure or agreements with oracle operators to process their
updates. A private feed has the added benefit of embedding API keys within a job
for any endpoints that require authentication, meaning a greater level of trust
is needed between publishers and oracles. These keys will need to be created by
individual oracle operators or provided by the private feed creator. The rest of
this article will be focused on public feeds requiring DAO approval.</p><p><strong><em>Lease Contract</em></strong></p><p>Oracle queues have a finite amount of resources proportional to its number of
oracles so the DAO may reject new feeds that could cause delays on existing
feeds. The publisher is responsible for creating a lease contract to reserve a
set amount of computer power from the oracle queue. Once a publisher’s feed is
accepted by the DAO, the feed is added to the network and granted permissions to
use the oracle queue resources.</p><p>Upon creating a lease contract, the publisher may specify a withdrawal authority
and fund the lease contract to reward oracle operators for processing any future
updates. The withdrawal authority allows a publisher to cancel and refund their
lease contract at any moment and specifies where any remaining lease balance is
sent. The lease fee is derived from the oracle rewards dictated by each oracle
queue. This value can be increased over time to entice additional oracles to
join the queue or decreased to entice additional publishers to submit new feeds.
If a data feed’s lease is low on funds, any update requests will fail and the
feed will be removed from any scheduled updates. As a feed gains popularity,
other dApp developers will be incentivized to extend the lease and keep it
active. This creates a natural decay where unused feeds go unfunded to make room
for new use cases.</p><p><strong><em>Oracle Queue</em></strong></p><p>The Switchboard DAO governs how its oracle resources get allocated and rewarded.
Oracles are arranged in a round-robin fashion, where once requested, the next N
oracles in the queue are assigned to a feed and cycled to the bottom. Oracle
positions are periodically swapped to mitigate oracles being assigned to the
same feeds each cycle. A single Oracle queue was architected to support over
100,000 oracles, but given rent costs, the initial implementation will cap queue
sizes at 2048 and increase it as the network grows.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="execution">Execution<a href="#execution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Execution" title="Direct link to Execution">​</a></h2><p><strong><em>The Crank</em></strong></p><p>Data feeds can also be configured so they are updated periodically or
on-command, depending on the feed’s use cases. Solana has no mechanism to
schedule periodic updates so a Crank is used to jump start the system. Any feed
approved by the DAO is free to join the oracle queue’s crank. The Crank is a
priority queue of data feed public keys ordered by the feeds next available
update time. When cranked, Switchboard will look for any data feeds ready for an
update and if successful, reward the user who called it. If no data feed is
ready to be updated, the crankers transaction will fail and they could
potentially lose their transaction fee. The crank is the scheduler behind the
oracles and incentivizes users to help keep the system spinning. Anyone can
compete to turn the crank but there can be only one!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2021-10-12-Switchboard-V2-Architecture-and-Data-Flows_Highlander-1073809360f15d81fd02bcbc9a29ba96.jpg" width="620" height="409" class="img_QIlm"></p><p>When a data feed update is detected, the oracle queue moves the next N oracles
to the back of the queue and passes the data feed public key to each oracle to
begin processing the update. Each oracle then reads the data feed configuration,
executes each job, then publishes their results on-chain. Oracles are always on
the queue and can process multiple feed updates when requested.</p><p><strong><em>Oracle Rewards</em></strong></p><p>If enough oracles successfully respond, an on-chain program will aggregate the
assigned oracle results and return the median value as the final result. Each
oracle is then scored based on their response. The variance threshold is
dictated by the DAO on a per queue basis and is used when determining the
validity of an oracle’s response in relation to the accepted, median result.
Oracles within the acceptable range are awarded whatever fee is set by the DAO.
Oracles who’s responses fall outside the acceptable range will be slashed and
must forfeit a set amount of their staked capital. The slashing mechanism
disincentivizes oracles from reporting dishonest data and helps protect the
system from nodes who may have other incentives to return false data. A future
article will detail the various incentives to entice nodes to remain honest.</p><p>Each feed keeps track of the number of successful and failed responses. If a
feed has persistent failures, then the feed is removed from the oracle queue and
the publisher is refunded the remaining balance on the lease contract to the
withdrawal authority specified when creating the lease contract.</p><p>The diagram below depicts the system in action:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2021-10-12-Switchboard-V2-Architecture-and-Data-Flows_FeedLifecycle-62c773cda9755daaeb2dda34b488a144.png" width="952" height="904" class="img_QIlm"></p><p>Switchboard V2 gives more ways for you to join the network, whether that’s
operating a node, publishing feeds, or cranking the system. We are excited to
roll out the next version of our community curated oracles and can’t wait to see
what the community builds with it!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Switchboard V1 let us show the community how data can be routed on-chain and
provided to smart contracts. Since inception, Switchboard has been adopted by
many projects across the Solana ecosystem including Mango Markets, Saber, LIQ,
and Solend, but we’re not done there. Switchboard V2 will build upon these
concepts and give more power to the community to determine the direction of the
project. Over the next few weeks we will be rolling out more information on the
design of V2 and look to the community for feedback. Without further ado, here
is an overview of some of the roles and responsibilities for Switchboard V2.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="How Data Feeds Are Added to the Network" src="/assets/images/2021-09-30-Switchboard-V2-Roles-and-Responsibilities_Roles-13710f566c1d5547916a917d929f1e4d.png" width="653" height="456" class="img_QIlm"></p><p>Switchboard V2 allows the community to decide which data should live on-chain.
Below are the main roles of the Switchboard ecosystem, and the functions each
role performs:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2021-09-30-Switchboard-V2-Roles-and-Responsibilities_AllTheData-790161914d134eaee64f873df6a2adf4.png" width="593" height="420" class="img_QIlm"></p><p><strong>Curators</strong> are the visionaries of the network and are responsible for finding
off-chain data the community may like to see on-chain and submitting proposals
to a registry. Curators are then rewarded with a percentage of revenue generated
from a data feed to incentivize community curation. The registry acts as a “Data
Store” where people can view proposed on-chain data.</p><p><strong>Publishers</strong> are responsible for browsing the registry and building data feeds
from a collection of “jobs” (endpoints). Publishers then finalize the data feed
configuration including its update interval, provide the upfront capital to fund
the data feed over a specified interval, and submit the data feed to the DAO for
the community to vote on.</p><p>The <strong>DAO</strong> has a few key responsibilities which include voting on adding
potential data feeds to the network. The DAO lets the community decide what data
should be published on chain.</p><p>If a submitted data feed has a low refresh rate such that it does not tax the
existing queue, it will be automatically granted permission to the network. Once
a data feed has been accepted to the network, it will be added to the oracle
queue and updated at its specified interval set by the publisher.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="How Oracles Are Added to the Network" src="/assets/images/2021-09-30-Switchboard-V2-Roles-and-Responsibilities_Nodes-8eb824e519519ffc9dc0694572302c4d.png" width="500" height="435" class="img_QIlm"></p><p><strong>Oracles</strong> are nodes who are responsible for fulfilling network requests and
act as the intermediary between the Solana blockchain and the internet. Oracles
with a set amount of capital staked are automatically granted approval to the
network. Oracles can also be added to the network by submitting a DAO proposal
and letting the community vote. An oracle is then ready to fulfill job requests
after a specified warm up period. Future articles will go into further details
with the incentives nodes have to remain honest.</p><p>As you can see Switchboard V2 puts more power into the hands of the community.
The DAO is responsible for what data is available on-chain and which nodes can
fulfill those requests. We are excited to roll out the next iteration of
Switchboard and can’t wait to see what the community builds with Switchboard!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Switchboard is a community-driven, decentralized oracle network built on Solana
that allows anyone to publish on-chain data for smart contract developers to
reliably build upon.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2021-09-22-Intro-to-Switchboard_Banner-2cf921e59b569616a13f71ad0e9979f9.png" width="900" height="450" class="img_QIlm"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="what-is-an-oracle">What is an Oracle?<a href="#what-is-an-oracle" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is an Oracle?" title="Direct link to What is an Oracle?">​</a></h2><p>Smart contracts are the building blocks of web3 and can be thought of as the
logic behind programmable money, although their use cases extend well beyond
just monetary transactions. A smart contract encapsulates some pre-defined logic
allowing anonymous participants to interact without a trusted intermediary. More
complex smart contracts might rely on external data from the web but blockchains
do not have the capability of directly relaying this information. Enter oracles.</p><p>Oracles are the gateway between a blockchain and the real world, providing the
mechanisms to arrive at a reliable consensus for a single data point when given
multiple sources. Oracles can then determine the most reliable value of the data
point after examining the provided answer of each data source. In this way,
oracles increase information integrity by removing the risk of a single point of
failure or outlier. Oracle services have many applicable uses in blockchain
based applications today, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Determining the current price of an asset for collateralized lending</p></li><li><p>Determining the state of a tracking number to auto settle funds on arrival</p></li><li><p>Determining the current standings of the MLB for fantasy sports rankings</p></li></ul><p>Oracles can be used for a variety of data sets as long as there is a reliable
way to source the information.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="what-is-switchboard">What is Switchboard?<a href="#what-is-switchboard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Switchboard?" title="Direct link to What is Switchboard?">​</a></h2><p>Switchboard is a community-driven, decentralized oracle network built on Solana
that allows anyone to publish on-chain data for smart contract developers to
reliably build upon. Switchboard is a community governed protocol — if
additional on-chain data is needed, head over to our

rates of on-chain data to help support it’s thriving developer ecosystem.
Developing an oracle solution in this high-availability environment poses its
own set of challenges that the Switchboard team is excited to solve!</p><p>Switchboard gets its name from the early days of phone networks, when operators
would shuffle telephone lines around a switchboard to complete a circuit and
forward a dialer’s call to the next hop in the circuit. Similarly, Switchboard
is responsible for how external data gets updated and routed through the Solana
blockchain until it reaches its appropriate destination.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="how-switchboard-v1-works">How Switchboard V1 Works<a href="#how-switchboard-v1-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Switchboard V1 Works" title="Direct link to How Switchboard V1 Works">​</a></h2><p>For the rest of this article I will use the results of the current MLB season to
show how oracles can be used and some of the security concerns Switchboard
addresses. <strong>Note</strong>: You can view the current MLB results on-chain at
<a href="https://switchboard.xyz/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">switchboard.xyz/explorer</a>.</p><p>Let’s say you make a bet with your only friend. If the NY Yankees finish the
season with more wins than the Red Sox, then your friend will give you an “I ❤
NY” NFT. However, if the Red Sox finish with more wins, you have to give your
friend a “Boston Strong” NFT. You’re both into cryptocurrency so you have no
other friends that could be the intermediary for the bet. Luckily, a smart
contract can hold both NFTs as collateral and only release the NFTs when the
season is complete. After the last game of the season, you invoke your smart
contract to settle the bet, which fetches the number of wins for each team and
returns the correct NFT to each party. Fairly straightforward, but let’s dive
deeper.</p><p>Switchboard works by first defining a <strong>Data Feed</strong>. The data feed account holds
the results of the oracle and can be updated on command or at some interval. For
this example we would have two data feeds, one for each team that defines their
total wins. These are the accounts the smart contract will use when the season
is over and we want to settle.</p><p>Each data feed is then populated with at least one <strong>Data Feed Job</strong> which
defines where and how the data is sourced. A job contains the API endpoint we
are fetching data from as well as the JSONPath Syntax which defines how to grab
the needed information from the API result. Switchboard also allows you to
conceal an API key within a job if the endpoint requires it for additional
security. For this use case it is best to source directly from the MLB’s API but
we would also want a few additional data sources to increase our confidence. So
now we’ve defined how to get the information and where to store it on-chain,
let’s see how the request gets fulfilled.</p><p>Next we need to assign the data feed to a <strong>Fulfillment Manager</strong>. The
fulfillment manager is responsible for orchestrating a cluster of <strong>Switchboard
Nodes</strong> to perform the next update for a linked data feed. Switchboard is a
community driven oracle so anyone can create their own fulfillment manager or
run a node to perform updates which in turn increases the overall integrity of
the network. When invoked by the fulfillment manager, each node is responsible
for reporting the median result of all assigned jobs to the on-chain smart
contract. The smart contract then aggregates the results from each node and
calculates the final result as the median of all node responses.</p><p>So now we’ve seen how external data gets routed through Switchboard and provided
on-chain. But what if there was more at stake? After all blockchains are
permission-less networks so trust should be minimized. To mitigate risk of API’s
reporting erroneous data we use the median result among the assigned jobs and
node responses to filter outliers. But how do we minimize malicious nodes from
submitting incorrect data? Stay tuned for more information on Switchboard V2!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="community-resources">Community Resources<a href="#community-resources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Community Resources" title="Direct link to Community Resources">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://switchboard.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/switchboard-xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/sNeGymrabT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://t.me/switchboardxyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telegram</a></p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to share that Switchboard has raised a $3.5MM seed round led by
Lemniscap to build out our community curated oracle network on Solana. This
round of funding allows us to continue our mission to bring support for the long
tail of data feeds on-chain in a decentralized, high-performance manner.</p><p>Participating investors included CMS Holdings, Taureon, Alameda Research, MGNR,
Collab + Currency, Divergence Ventures, Zeal Capital, SCC Investments, JST
Capital as well as angel investors Chris McCann, former Solana General Counsel
Ryon Nixon and Recur executive Paul J Martin among others.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2021-06-17-Switchboard-Raises-3.5MM-Seed_CapTable-acbc6e45d17b24da833e233c1fdcf51c.png" width="1600" height="1600" class="img_QIlm"></p><p>Chris McCann, an early seed investor in Solana, FTX, and backer of Switchboard
said:</p><blockquote><p>“The Switchboard team is building on-chain data feeds and oracles which are
some of the most critical infrastructure layers for all DeFi projects on
Solana. “Every single DeFi project needs price oracles to rely on for their
own products to function properly. On top of this, Switchboard has generalized
their product to include all kinds of data feeds outside of pure price, which
will all be community-driven and adopted. “This, in combination with Solana’s
low latency and high throughput will create a reliable data layer the whole
ecosystem can rely on.”</p></blockquote><p>Switchboard was incubated by Manna, a proprietary trading and investment firm
founded by Zach Bruch and Chris Hermida. Bruch has worked and held leadership
positions at three of the largest and most established institutional trading
desks in the industry — Kraken, Cumberland/DRW, and JST Capital. Hermida
formerly led trading in Europe for Circle, and most recently was Global Co-head
of OTC trading at JST Capital.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_WPED" id="mainnet-beta">Mainnet Beta<a href="#mainnet-beta" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mainnet Beta" title="Direct link to Mainnet Beta">​</a></h2><p>As part of the raise, we’re also excited to announce our mainnet beta.
Switchboard is the first oracle network to enable feeds on Solana’s mainnet —
allowing developers to take advantage of Solana’s low transaction fees and fast
confirmation times.</p><p>If you’re building an application relying on on-chain data feeds or are
