## Introduction to the Switchboard Attestation Program

Previously, Switchboard's security model depended on economic incentives where
data reporters were rewarded or penalized based on the proximity of their
reported data to the median. Oracle operators had to lock up a portion of
economic stake and receive explicit approval from the oracle queue's authority.
Although this model provided a degree of decentralization and security, it faced
challenges in aligning the incentives of oracles with DeFi protocols.

The Switchboard Attestation Program builds upon Switchboard V2s enconomic
incentives by leveraging TEEs. TEEs allow for unique digital signatures to be
created for software running within its enclave, along with the data generated
by that software. This ensures the secure and verifiable confirmation of the
oracles' integrity and authenticity.

The Switchboard Attestation Program is a sibling program to the Switchboard
oracle program, and is responsible for verifying attestation quotes on-chain,
which grants or revokes an oracle's permissions based on the contents within the
secure enclave. By verifying the code's integrity inside the enclave, we can
ensure the code hasn't been tampered with and that our application will behave
as expected.

A ServiceQueueAccount manages a set of valid
[MRENCLAVE](./tee.mdx/#term-mrenclave) measurements, representing the permitted
software versions an application can run. Any code changes will alter the
enclave's state, necessitating the addition of a new measurement by the
ServiceQueueAccount `authority` before oracles can upgrade. If a version is
found to have a bug, it can be revoked, and oracles will automatically be
removed.

An oracle account represents a specific SGX enclave. When an oracle is
provisioned, it creates a QuoteAccount on-chain with the MRENCLAVE measurement
detailing the software version it runs. Quote verification oracles constantly
monitor the chain for oracles requesting verification of their enclave. Upon
detecting such an event, it calls the program and updates or revokes the
associated PermissionAccount based on whether the measurement is allowed on the
oracle's ServiceQueueAccount.

ServiceQueueAccounts dictate how often oracles must verify their enclave,
ensuring that enclaves consistently update and maintain software patches.

With the Attestation Program, Switchboard V3 enables:

- **Oracle Verification**: Oracles are encapsulated within TEEs, generating a
  unique digital signature that can be posted on-chain for public verification.
  This ensures that the oracles can be trusted while maintaining a decentralized
  and verifiable system.
- **Execution Verification**: As oracles participate in a queue and handle user
  requests, the executions of data feeds, functions, and other tasks can be
  verifiably carried out. This allows users to confirm that transactions are
  strictly dictated by the code that created them, ensuring system integrity and
  security.

## Exploring SGX Attestation

Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) offer a secure execution environment
called an enclave, where sensitive code and data are protected from unauthorized
access or tampering. The attestation process verifies the enclave's identity and
validates its code and data, ensuring authenticity and integrity.

The Switchboard Attestation Program uses SGX attestation to establish trust in
oracle applications, providing a robust mechanism for verifying secure code
execution within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

Switchboard services utilize Gramine for the runtime environment. Gramine allows
SGX enclaves to operate as if they were running on a standard operating system,
managing system calls and other essential interactions.

## Crucial Components in the Attestation Process

The Switchboard attestation process involves several components that work
together to facilitate attestation and verification of SGX enclaves:

- **ServiceQueueAccount**: Manages the list of allowed enclave measurements
  (MRENCLAVEs) and maintains a dedicated VerifierQueue to verify attestations.
- **NodeAccount**: Represents an individual SGX enclave, connects to the
  ServiceQueueAccount, and has a 1:N relationship with QuoteAccount.
- **PermissionAccount**: An account between the _ServiceQueueAccount_ and the
  _NodeAccount_ dictating whether the _NodeAccount_ is permitted to perform
  on-chain actions.
- **QuoteAccount**: Stores the attestation data (quote) generated by the SGX
  enclave for a given NodeAccount.

## Attestation Lifecycle

The Switchboard Attestation Program follows a structured lifecycle to ensure the
secure and trustworthy execution of code within the TEE:

1. Initialize the ServiceQueueAccount
2. Register permitted MRENCLAVE measurements
3. Create NodeAccount and PermissionAccount
4. Run an SGX Switchboard function, creates QuoteAccount from compiled binary
5. QuoteAccount emits a request to the VerifierQueue associated with the
   ServiceQueue to verify its MRENCLAVE measurement
6. The VerifierQueue verifies the MRENCLAVE measurement on-chain (attestation)
7. The PermissionAccount associated with the NodeAccount has the permissions
   enabled
8. Maintain an active and trustworthy SGX enclave through heartbeats

By adhering to this lifecycle, the Switchboard Attestation Program ensures the
security, authenticity, and trustworthiness of SGX enclaves operating within the
TEE.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<a name="faq-1"></a>

### Role of VerifierQueue in the attestation process

The VerifierQueue is a set of on-chain oracles that watch the chain for events
from QuoteAccounts to verify their MRENCLAVE measurements. When verified
on-chain, the associated PermissionAccounts' permission flags are enabled,
indicating they have permission to operate on the queue and be delegated work or
compute requests.

<a name="faq-2"></a>

### Adding, updating, and removing MRENCLAVE measurements

The ServiceQueueAccount's `authority` field is allowed to make changes to the
permitted enclave measurements. This could be a DAO-controlled account where
participants vote on new trusted code to operate on their program or dApp.

<a name="faq-3"></a>

### Understanding PermissionAccount and its role in access control

The PermissionAccount is a program-derived address between a ServiceQueueAccount
and NodeAccount. When a NodeAccount attempts to operate on a
ServiceQueueAccount, the PermissionAccount is loaded and its settings are
verified against the ServiceQueueAccount settings.

<a name="faq-4"></a>

### How SGX enclaves generate attestation data (quote) for QuoteAccount

The QuoteAccount keypair is generated during the initial execution of the code
using entropy derived from within the SGX enclave. The quote is generated from
the a fingerprint of the application binary running within the enclave to verify
it hasn't been tampered with. The oracles use the Gramine runtime, which
provides the abstraction to run the application.

<a name="faq-5"></a>

### Switchboard Attestation Program as a special oracle

The attestation oracles verify the signed measurement against the queue's
accepted MRENCLAVEs and invoke an on-chain transaction, which performs the
account checks. If the measurement is invalid, the NodeAccount's associated
PermissionAccount's permissions are revoked, and the Node is blocked from
performing any access-controlled actions like heartbeating or being delegated
work.

<a name="faq-6"></a>

### Heartbeat mechanism and maintaining an active SGX enclave

A NodeAccount is required to heartbeat before the
`service_queue.last_heartbeat`. If they do not, they are removed from the queue,
and their permissions are revoked, meaning they will not be assigned any future
work until they heartbeat again. A NodeAccount is also required to re-verify its
MRENCLAVE measurement before the `service_queue.max_quote_verification_age`.
