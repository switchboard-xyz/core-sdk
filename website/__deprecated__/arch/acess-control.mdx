Oracle queue resources, such as oracles, aggregators, VRF accounts, or buffer
relayer accounts, _MUST_ have an associated PermissionAccount initialized before
interacting with a queue. Permissions are granted by `queue.authority`, which
could be a DAO controlled account to allow network participants to vote on new
entrants.

Oracles _MUST_ have **PermitOracleHeartbeat** permissions before heartbeating on
a queue. This is to prevent a malicious actor from spinning up a plethora of
oracles until it obtains the super majority, at which point it could misreport
data feed results and cause honest oracles to be slashed.
