An aggregator or data feed is what on-chain developers use when building smart
contracts. A data feed is a collection of jobs that get aggregated to produce a
single, deterministic result. Typically the first task in a job will fetch
external data with subsequent tasks responsible for parsing the response and
transforming the value into a single data type, like an integer or decimal.

When an oracle is assigned to process a data feed update, the oracle executes
the defined jobs, computes the weighted median of the job responses, and
publishes the result on-chain. If sufficient oracles respond, the on-chain
program computes the final result as the median of the assigned oracle
responses.

<Grid container spacing={3}>
  <Grid item md={4} sm={12} order={{ xs: 2, sm: 1 }}>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Aggregator: </b>Contains the data feed configuration, dictating how
        data feed updates get requested, updated, and resolved on-chain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Job Account: </b>Stores the blueprints for how data is fetched
        off-chain for a particular data source.

      <li>
        <b>Permission Account: </b>Permits a data feed to join an oracle queue.
      </li>
      <li>

        their work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Crank: </b>Optional, owned by the queue and allows a data feed to be
        updated at a regular interval.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>History Buffer: </b>Optional, allows a feed to store the last N
        values.

## Job Definitions

An Aggregator Account stores a collection of Job Account public keys along with
the hashes of the job definitions. This is to prevent malicious RPC nodes from
providing incorrect task definitions to oracles before fulfillment.

A Job Account is a collection of Switchboard Tasks that get executed by an
oracle sequentially. Each Job Account typically corresponds to a single data
source. A data feed requires at least one job account and at most 16 job
accounts. Switchboard Job Accounts can be used to source data from:

- HTTP endpoints, public or private$^{[1]}$
- Websockets
- On-Chain data from Solana, Ethereum, etc
  - Anchor programs
  - JupiterSwap
  - Uniswap
  - SushiSwap
  - Saber
  - ... and more

$^{[1]}$ Endpoints requiring an API key require a
[Private APIs](/guides/feeds/private-apis) to prevent leaking the API key
on-chain

### Job Weights

A data feed can assign job weights to a job account which will be used when the
oracle calculates the median across the job responses. This is useful to weight
data sources by some metric such as liquidity or a reliability score.

It is **strongly** recommended to utilize job weights as _not all data sources
are created equally_.

:::info

Currently the only way to set a job weight is to remove and re-add the job
account to a feed.

## Data Feed Composability

Data feeds may reference other data feeds and build upon each other. It is
**_strongly_** recommended that you own any feed that you reference in case of
downstream impacts out of your control. While anyone can extend another feeds
lease, a lease owner can always withdraw any lease funds and prevent future
updates.

As an example, you could construct the following feed definition:

- Create a Switchboard feed that sources SOL/USD prices from a variety of
  exchanges, each weighted by their 7d volume, along with a history buffer
- Create a Switchboard feed that uses an OracleTask to fetch the Pyth SOL/USD
  price every 10 seconds, along with a history buffer
- Create a Switchboard feed that uses an OracleTask to fetch the Chainlink
  SOL/USD price every 10 seconds, along with a history buffer
- Finally, create a Switchboard feed that calculates the 1min TWAP of each
  source above and returns the median of the results

This is just a small window into how Switchboard feeds can build on each other
and let the downstream consumer configure their feeds to meet their own use
cases.

## Cost

Each data feed has a LeaseContract, whcih is a pre-funded escrow account to
reward oracles for fulfilling update request. The LeaseContract has a
pre-specified `lease.withdrawAuthority` which is the only wallet allowed to
withdraw funds from the lease escrow. Any user is able to contribute to a
LeaseContract and keep the feed updating.

When a new openRound is successfully requested for a data feed, the user who
requested it is transferred `queue.reward` tokens from the feeds LeaseContract.
This is to incentivize users and crank turners to keep feeds updating based on a
feeds config.

When a data feed result is accepted on-chain by a batch of oracles, the oracle
rewards, as specified by `queue.reward`, are automatically deducted from the
`lease.escrow` and transferred to an `oracle.tokenAccount`.

### Update Request Cost

Each data feed update cost can be calculated by the following equation:

$T_{costPerUpdate}=(1 + numSuccess) × T_{queueReward}$

where,

- `T` is the raw token amount in base units (_Ex: lamports or satoshis_)
- _`+1`_ is to reward the update requester for keeping the feed updating
- `numSuccess` is the number of successful oracle responses, which will always
  be between `[aggregator.minOracleResults, aggregator.oracleRequestBatchSize]`
- `queue.reward` is the queue's set oracle reward

If an update round fails to receive `minOracleResults`, only the update
requester receives funds from the lease escrow.

### Variance Threshold

A feed can set an `aggregator.varianceThreshold` to instruct an oracle to skip
reporting a value on-chain if the percentage change between the current result
and the `aggregator.previousConfirmedRoundResult` is not exceeded. This is a
cost saving tool to conserve lease cost during low volatility.

A feeds `aggregator.forceReportPeriod` is the compliment and instructs an oracle
to always report a result if `aggregator.forceReportPeriod` seconds have elapsed
since the last successful confirmed round. This can be thought of as the maximum
allowable staleness for a feed.

The two settings above can greatly increase the lifespan of a feed's lease but
also makes it difficult to estimate the remaining time on a lease.

## Maintenance

The following highlights some basic maintenance you should employ when creating
your own Switchboard feed.

- **Monitor Lease Funds** — you should monitor your feeds lease account for low
  balances. When a feed’s lease is emptied, it will no longer process new
  updates until it has enough to reward the oracles processing the update. We
  are working with a few web3 messaging services to enable wallet notifications
  when leases are low on funds.
- **Monitor Crank Eviction** — if a lease is emptied, it will also be evicted
  from its crank. Switchboard feeds act like public utilities where anyone is
  free to re-push it to a crank, as long as it doesn’t have
  `aggregator.disableCrank` set to true.
- **Monitor Data Sources** — Sometimes APIs change or move. High availability
  feeds should have some basic routine health checks to ensure their on-chain
  data is updating as expected.
- **Monitor Priority Fees** - Solana data feeds may specify a priority fee
  configuration in order to push updates through during periods of congestion.
  You should monitor the average priority fee for the network and update as
  needed.
