# Switchboard Data Pipelines

In this page, we cover the different methods of data pipelines that our
oracle network can support. Oracles are becoming more sophisticated and
offer multi-dimensional toolings to developers. Traditional oracles utilizes
the Push method to constantly stream data on-chain, while the recent emergence
introduces a Pull method that we will explore.

Before we deep dive into the different data pipelines, we first have to
understand the key considerations on the protocol side and why they are important.

## Key Considerations

- **Cost**: The method of bringing data on-chain and the frequency of updates
  directly influences the costs of running a data feed.
- **Steps for Data Retrieval**: The number of steps a protocol needs to take
  to read the data affects latency and MEV-resistibility.
- **Integration**: The architecture of the oracles and the method of bringing
  data on-chain affects the integration complexities.
- **End user effects**: The ultimate impact lays on the end users, where the
  method of data pipeline can alter different experiences.

## Push

The Push pipeline is a process of constant streaming of data directly from
the data source to the blockchain. All data updates propagated directly on-chain
by oracles lead to the most efficient in terms of latency. However, due to the
design of constant pushing of data, it is more expensive.

### How it works

- Protocol creates and funds an **on-chain** data feed with specific parameters
  such as update frequency and job definitions.
- // Insert queue and crank details
- Based on the configurations of each data feed, the oracles will fetch data to
  update the results directly on-chain.
- Protocols read the data feed and utilize the data for its end users.

## Pull

The Pull pipeline is a process of active off-chain data updates and oracle
signatures into a decentralized datastore while protocols passively requests
for updates by pulling the results on-chain. The method suggests that a less
expensive method as data is updated on a global layer and only fetched on-chain
when necessary.

### How it works

- Protocol creates and funds an **off-chain** data feed with specific
  parameters such as update frequency and job definitions that lives
  in the decentralized datastore.
- Based on the configurations of each data feed, the oracles will fetch
  data to update the results with its oracle signature into the decentralized
  datastore.
- Protocols **pulls** the data and oracle signature from the off-chain
  datastore which gets verified and utilized.

## Callback

The Callback pipeline is a process of on-demand data updates invoked by a
user action where the data is directly propagated on-chain into a data bucket
as part of the receiving protocol. The method suggests a new approach to receiving
data on-chain which means oracles update only when necessary providing MEV resistance.

### How it works

// insert diagram

- Protocol writes and deploys an on-chain data feed built as a Function.
- Function Manager constantly watches for the data feed that are ready in order to
  execute.
- Function Manager spins up an enclave container within an oracle for the data feed.
- User interacts with the protocol which creates a data bucket and invokes a callback.
- Each data feed runs, creating a signed transaction which is sent to the quote
  verifier daemon for verification.
- Quote verifier approves and signs the output, triggering a callback to update
  the on-chain data bucket.
- Finally, the callback with the data update fulfills the pending user action.

## Summary

To conclude, each data pipeline model is unique and has its own advantages/disadvantages.
At Switchboard, we believe the in the idea of Bring Your Own Oracle (BYOO) where the
ultimate decision of integration style is up to the protocol itself. To assist you in
having a better understanding of the core differences of each data pipeline model, here's
a table of the aforementioned key considerations.
