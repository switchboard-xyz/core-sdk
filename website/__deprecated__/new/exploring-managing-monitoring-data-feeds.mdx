# Exploring, Managing and Monitoring Data Feeds

> _"With great power of permissionless-ness and customizability,_ > _comes great responsibility of monitoring and managing."_

> - Switchboard

Switchboard enables developers to create data feeds permissionless-ly and
ability to specify custom data endpoints, level of oracle security and granular
configurations such as frequency of updates. Through the Switchboard App, you
not only build the data feeds, but we have created an Explorer to help you
manage and monitor them.

:::note

The following guide on **Exploring, Monitoring and Managing Data Feeds**
covers browsing and handling post-creation phase on data feeds through the
Switchboard App's Feed Builder and the CLI.

The Switchboard App is a fully permissionless oracle app where anyone can
create any data feed right now, try it if you have not!

For more information on "Building Data Feeds", check this [page](https://docs.switchboard.xyz/guides/).

## Navigating the Switchboard App

By default, the home page on the App is the Switchboard Explorer where you
browse and manage your own and other users' data feeds. There are 3 main pages
within the App's GUI:

- **Switchboard Explorer**: The main explorer where you get an overview
  of the data feeds that are created and updating live.
- **My Explorer**: Essentially, your personal profile page where you get
  to monitor and manage your data feeds seamlessly.
- **Builder**: The tool to provide a low-code graphical user interface to
  write and deploy your data feeds.

:::tip

Using the My Explorer, you are able to view your own personal solutions,
while using the main Explorer, you can select a authority address to view
the solutions that authority controls.

## Managing and Monitoring Data Feeds

Once you've created your desired data feeds for integrating into your
protocol, you will need to actively manage and monitor it, assuming
it is a core data pipeline for your protocol to function as intended.

Here's a list of management checklist that you can refer to:

- **Data Feed Configurations**: If you have made any protocol side
  changes, ensure that if it does require a change in data feed
  configurations, you can do so in the app in the detailed feed page.
- **Lease Management**: Ensure the lease of the data feed is regularly
  topped up to allow the data feed to update smoothly as intended.
  Despite locking a data feed (preventing further configurations and
  job definition changes), you can still withdraw your funds out of the
  lease.
- **Job Management**: This is especially important for **price** data
  feeds. Ensure an active monitoring of market conditions for the specific
  asset. In times of poor or anamoly market conditions such as an exchange
  failing to update via it's API, exchange collapsing, etc, it is your
  responsibility as the data feed authority to update your job definitions
  in order to maintain integrity of the data feed and its intended usage.
- **Data Liveness**: Ensure your data feeds are updating as its intended
  configurations. You can do so by viewing it's on-chain activity and
  we have included `saveResults` transactions in the oracle logs within
  each detailed feed page.
- **Crank Status**: If a lease is emptied, it will also be evicted from
  its crank. Switchboard feeds act like public utilities where anyone is
  free to re-push it to a crank, as long as it doesn’t have disableCrank
  set to true.
