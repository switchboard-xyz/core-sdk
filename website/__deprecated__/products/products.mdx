| Product                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [üîç Switchboard Explorer](/explorer)           | A monitoring tool for data published across Switchboard networks, allowing users to examine feed configurations and update frequencies. Developers can track the performance of a specific price feed to ensure reliability and accuracy for their DeFi applications.                                                               |
| [üöß Switchboard Publisher](/publisher)         | A web app enabling developers to create custom Switchboard feeds (Switchboard Streams) or aSync functions, streamlining the process of integrating oracle networks into their projects. DeFi platform's can create a custom feed for tracking asset prices, ensuring accurate pricing information for swaps and other transactions. |
| [üìà Switchboard Feeds](/feeds)                 | A feature supporting efficient on-chain data feeds that get updated at specified intervals, ideal for applications requiring real-time data updates. A decentralized lending platform could use Switchboard Feeds to access updated collateral prices, ensuring accurate liquidation triggers and avoiding incorrect liquidations.  |
| [üß© Switchboard Functions](/functions)         | Provides secure SGX enclaves for running custom logic, ensuring data confidentiality even if the infrastructure is compromised. A developer could use Switchboard Functions to run complex risk assessment algorithms and execute trades on-chain, allowing liquidity providers to verify the algorithm being executed.             |
| [üîí Switchboard Secrets](/secrets)             | Allows secure access to private on-chain data for computation, making it a valuable asset for applications handling sensitive information. A protocol could use Switchboard secrets to access an off-chain private database and verify user credentials on-chain.                                                                   |
| [üé≤ Switchboard pSeudorandomness](/randomness) | Offers on-chain publication of pseudo-random values, which can be used to generate unpredictable outcomes in applications. An on-chain lottery system integrated into a DeFi platform can use Switchboard pSeudorandomness to draw winning numbers fairly, ensuring a transparent and tamper-proof lottery process for users.       |
