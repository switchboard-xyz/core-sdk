# The Data Models

The following sections depict the different ways of data propagation provided by
oracles and how developers can integrate Switchboard to have full control over
how data is sourced on-chain for their smart contracts.

## Push

Data is _**pushed**_ on-chain by the oracle at a routine interval. The
integrator just needs to verify the data was recently pushed and doesn't need to
handle any off-chain requesting.

Switchboard Functions allow you to set up functions on a cron schedule, which
essentially performs the same as a push based oracle. See
[Switchboard Functions](/functions) for more information.

## Pull (Not supported)

Data is first fetched and maintained in a data store (it can be another
blockchain, sub-chain or centralized database). From this data store, the data
is then _**pulled**_ on-chain by the integrator.

## Callback

Data is sourced off-chain each time it is requested and populated on-chain with
a callback into the callers smart contract. This method is more complex to
integrate but is less susceptible to oracle attacks because the data is only
sourced when the user requests it.

Switchboard Functions allow you to set up functions on a callback model, which
allows you to trigger based on events and pass in parameters. See
[Switchboard Functions](/functions) for more information.

## Comparison

Each type of data propagation method poses their own advantages. The following
table compares the different criteria that should be looked at when deciding
which method is best for your specific solution.

| Method   | Settlement Time             | Cost                                              | Data Availability (Staleness)     |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Push     | Instant (dependent on RPCs) | Expensive (constant streams even when not needed) | Data is stale between each update |
| Pull     | Await bridge and data store | Inexpensive (requests only when needed)           | Data is fresh upon each pull      |
| Callback | Await function execution    | Inexpensive (updates based on events)             | Data is fresh upon each callback  |
