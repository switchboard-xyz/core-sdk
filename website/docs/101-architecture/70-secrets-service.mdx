### What are Secrets?
Secrets are sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and database 
credentials. In order to bring these types of information on-chain without 
leaking the secrets, it is important to store them securely so unauthorized 
individuals cannot access/tamper with them.

### How it works

![Switchboard Secrets](/img/arch/secrets.png)

1. Store your secrets as key-value pairs in the server.
2. When your Switchboard Function needs to access a secret, it sends a request 
   to the server.
3. The server verifies the request using SGX-generated "quotes", ensuring only 
   authorized Functions can access secrets.
4. If authorized, the server encrypts the secret with a key generated by the 
   Function's enclave and returns it.
5. The secret is decrypted within the Function's secure enclave, ensuring 
   confidentiality.

### Benefits to using Switchboard Secrets
* **Securely store secrets:** Keep your secrets outside your Switchboard Functions 
  and only decrypt them within the SGX enclave for confidentiality and security.
* **Easy integration:** Easily access your secrets directly from your Switchboard 
  Function with simple SDK calls.
* **Self-hosting option:** You can self-host the server for ultimate control and privacy.
