If you're new to Switchboard, do check out the unique properties of our oracle 
architecture in order to fully utilize the oracle protocol!

For a deeper dive, read our whitepaper here: (insert whitepaper)

### Introducing Switchboard

Remember the traditional telecommunication systems where switchboard operators 
manually establish connections by plugging switchboards to facilitate calls 
between parties. Similarly, Switchboard, the oracle protocol, employs a 
decentralized quorum of oracles to shuffle data on a blockchain, empowering 
smart contract developers to build with real world information on a blockchain.

### Switchboard Services

Switchboard Services is a set of developer tools built for simplicity, 
seamlessness and permissionlessness for developers to focus on writing the code that matters. 
The Services are currently supporting these products: Data Feeds, Randomness and 
Functions. Apart from these, any party can set up their own Switchboard 
infrastructure for isolated usage as Switchboard is designed to be modular.


<CustomDetails header="Data Feeds">

Switchboard provides a revolutionary developer-focused Data Feed Builder, 
where developers can spend less than 5 minutes to create a data feed 
utilizing any data source: not exclusive to off-chain sources like CoinGecko API, 
Binance API, on-chain sources like Uniswap Task, Jupiter Task, and Switchboard 
Secrets (off-chain private data sources).

</CustomDetails>


<CustomDetails header="Randomness">

Switchboard provides a simple, secure randomness service, where developers 
can send a request to a program to call the randomness generation event that is 
off-chain, within a secure enclave. Alternatively, a separate commit-to-
reveal randomness model or a fully custom function can be utilized as well.

</CustomDetails>


<CustomDetails header="Functions">

Switchboard provides a low level custom solution for all types of off-chain 
computations such as a performing data feed, a randomness generator, a risk 
engine or others, where developers write and deploy a function to container 
and is executed within a secure enclave of an oracle when triggered based on 
a routine (cron-schedule) or request (on-demand).

### Switchboard Architecture

Switchboard is built with security first, utilizing a unique approach of a 
verifiable execution layer built with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) 
technology paired with economic security governed by the SWITCH and XSWITCH 
tokens.


<CustomDetails header="Oracles (Nodes)">

The Switchboard protocol is run by a quorum of permissionless node operators, 
where its nodes utilize TEE techonology and economic security to create a 
network to verify oracle software and incentivize them based on their honest 
executions.

</CustomDetails>


<CustomDetails header="Queues">

Switchboard takes a modular approach towards its infrastructure where 
different parties can set up their own Switchboard Queue for differing use cases 
and onboard a set of nodes governed by the Switchboard Attestation Program.

</CustomDetails>


<CustomDetails header="Programs">

**Switchboard Attestation Program:** The brain of the protocol where it conducts 
governance, delegating executions and verification of oracles and its executions.

**Data Feeds Program:** A data layer built on top of the Attestation 
Program where users define their aggregators (data feeds) and triggers the oracles 
to complete its request, afterwhich the Attestation Program conducts the verification 
and submits the data back to the Data Feed Program for protocols to utilize.

**Randomness Program:** A request layer where users send their randomness 
requests to the program and receive directly back in their own program.
