Switchboard provides a permissionless and customizable method for developers 
to create and manage their own data feeds. In order to fully utilize this product, 
please refer to [On Demand Data Feed Service](../../architecture/on-demand-service) 
and [Push Data Feed Service](../../architecture/push-service) to understand the architecture. 
For integration guide, please refer to the [Request From On Demand Service Guide](./request-from-on-demand-service).

### Quick Recap

<CustomDetails header="What is a Feed, a Job and a Task?">

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Feed | It is an on-chain account that is made of various configurations, jobs, and the save result details. |
| Job  | It is a hash generated from a pre-defined work schema such as fetching latest quote from Jupiter. |
| [Task](../../api/protos/Task) | Is is a function for various types of Job operations such as an `HttpTask`, `JupiterSwapTask`, `CacheTask`, `MultiplyTask`, etc. |

</CustomDetails>

<CustomAdmonition type="tip">

In order to build Data Feeds outside the constraints or sandbox of the 
pre-built task types, you can utilize Switchboard Functions to perform more dynamic 
executions such as VWAPs, bulk updates.

Read [Function Service](../../architecture/function-service) to find out more.

### Identify Data & Its Sources

Since Switchboard allows you to set up your very own data feeds,
you'll need to provision your own data sources, be it on-chain data 
such as Jupiter, off-chain public data such as Binance API or private 
off-chain data such as enterprise data solutions, sportsbook, insurance, etc
(possible through [Switchboard Secrets](../../architecture/secrets-service)!).

1. Identify what is the data you want to be brought on-chain: price, weather, sports are all achievable
2. Identify the data source, we've curated a list of [Frequently Used Data Sources](./frequently-used-data-sources) for reference

<CustomAdmonition type="tip">

Utilize price aggregation explorers such as CoinGecko, Birdeye or Solscan 
to identify the price sources supporting your market pair (for example, 
Binance or Jupiter)

</CustomAdmonition>

3. Once you've identified the data you need and the sources supporting it, now you can build the Data Feed in 3 methods: 
  - Drag-n-drop
  - Importing JSON/YAML
  - CLI

### Building The Data Feed

To simplify this example walkthrough, we'll be assuming the creation of a 
price feed fetching the data of `SOL/USD` market pair and the images below 
from CoinGecko and Solscan are the representations of the market data 
which can be utilized as price sources.

        <li>Select the designated chain and network</li>
        <li>Dependent on the type of price data source, the task types that you utilize will differ largely:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Off-chain Data Sources:</strong> Typically, a market pair such as SOL/USD is supported on Centralized Exchanges (CEX) API endpoints. In order to fetch the data, you will need to use the HttpTask and JsonParseTask to firstly hit the endpoint then parse the specific field such as $.price.</li>
          <li><strong>On-chain Data Sources:</strong> You will need to use the LpExchangeRateTask and input the specific pair/pool address from the Decentralized Exchanges (DEX).</li>
          <li><strong>On-chain Data Sources:</strong> Some data can be fetched directly from on-chain accounts and calculated more accurately compared to DeFi markets (prone to price manipulations). In such cases, we can utilize a combination of tasks such as SolanaAccountDataFetchTask, SplStakePoolTask, SplTokenParseTask, CacheTask, BufferLayoutParseTask.</li>
          <li><strong>More Cases:</strong> There are other situations where the market pair is inversed such as USD/SOL or SOL denominated in JitoSOL and by doing simple math, you can achieve your final desired results.</li>
          <li><strong>Other Methods & <a href="./data-feed-best-practices">Best Practices</a>:</strong> The responsibility of creating data feeds lies in the hands of the protocols, in order to fully utilize the Data Feed Program and Task Runner, there are other task types such as BoundTask, ConditionalTask and indicators such as TWAP, EWMA that can further improve data resilience.</li>
