# The Data Models

The following sections depict the different ways developers can integrate
Switchboard to have full control over how data is sourced on-chain for their
smart contracts.

## Push

Data is _**pushed**_ on-chain by the oracle at a routine interval. The
integrater just needs to verify the data was recently pushed and doesn't need to
handle any off-chain requesting.

- **Integration Effort**: Low
- **Cost**: Med-High, depends on feed configuration and data availability
  requirements
- **Reliability**: Low-Med, risk of data being stale. requires multiple oracles
  to be online.
- **Security**: Med, depends on feeds configuration and the oracle queue it
  belongs to.

See [Data Feeds](/data-feeds) for more information.

## Pull (Coming Soon)

Data is maintained in a data store and _**pulled**_ on-chain by the integrator.

- **Integration Effort**: Low-Med
- **Cost**: Low-Med
- **Reliability**: Med, requires clients to pull in signatures themselves.
- **Security**: Med

## Callback

Data is sourced off-chain each time it is requested and populated on-chain with
a callback into the callers smart contract. This method is more complex to
integrate but is less susceptible to oracle attacks because the data is only
sourced when the user requests it.

- **Integration Effort**: High, requires an interface into your program for
  Switchboard verifiers to call.
- **Cost**: Low, only requires a single oracle to fulfill.
- **Reliability**: High, anyone can run a node and fulfill the update as long as
  it is running code specified by the functions MrEnclave.
- **Security**: High, code is verified during each execution.

See [Switchboard Functions](/functions) for more information.
