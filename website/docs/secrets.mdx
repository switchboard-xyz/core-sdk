# Secrets

## Overview

There is some information, of course which you do not want to make publicly
visible on chain or inside your docker container. What if you want to fetch
Uniswap liquidity information but dont want to expose your Infura API key in
your container? For this, you can use Switchboard Secrets.

## More Info

Coming Soon!
