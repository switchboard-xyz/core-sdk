title: Priority Fees
description: "Learn how to configure priority fees on your Solana data feed."
---

Switchboard data feeds on Solana allow you to set custom priority fees so your
data feed updates are expedited by the current slot leader processing
transactions. Priority fees are a small bump to the base transaction fee that
entices the validator to process your transaction ahead of others. The total
priority fee calculation is a function of the feed's `oracleRequestBatchSize`,
the feed's current staleness, and the feed's priority fee config. The priority
fee is automatically deducted from the feed's lease each time an update is
submitted by an oracle on-chain.

Priority fees are a new feature on Solana and will continue to be evaluated as
the network matures. Adding a `basePriorityFee` of 1 will allow your feed to
skip most transactions with minimal impact to your feed's cost.

The following settings can be modified on a per feed basis.

| Config                       | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **basePriorityFee**          | A fee added to each `save_result` instruction, irregardless of a feed's staleness. In units of microlamports per compute unit. |
| **priorityFeeBumpPeriod**    | The number of seconds of feed staleness before bumping the priority fee.                                                       |
| **maxPriorityFeeMultiplier** | The maximum number of `priorityFeeBumpPeriod`'s to bump a feed.                                                                |
| **priorityFeeBump**          | An additional fee to affix per `priorityFeeBumpPeriod` of staleness. In units of microlamports per compute unit.               |

## Fee Bump Calculation

$N_{Multiplier} =$ minimum of
$\frac{T_{Now}-T_{lastUpdate}}{\boldsymbol{\mathbf{}priorityFeeBumpPeriod}}$ and
$\boldsymbol{\mathbf{}maxPriorityFeeMultiplier}$

$FeeBump(\frac{micro\;lamports}{compute units})=\boldsymbol{basePriorityFee}\;+\;\mathbf{priorityFeeBump}\;\bullet\;N_{Multiplier}$

:::tip Typescript SDK

You can view the Typescript implementation of this calculation in
[AggregatorAccount.calculatePriorityFee](/api/solana.js/class/AggregatorAccount#calculatePriorityFee).

## Examples

For example, a feed with the priority fee config below will yield the following
priority fee bump curve:

- `basePriorityFee` = **_10_**
- `priorityFeeBumpPeriod` = **_30_**
- `maxPriorityFeeMultiplier` = **_10_**
- `priorityFeeBump` = **_25_**
