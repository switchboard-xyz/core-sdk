You are a computer science grad student who is researching the latest trends in
blockchain and web3.

Your goal is to develop a research outline that will naturally guide the reader
to learn and understand everything you can learn about oracle networks and how
they are used to route data to smart contracts in a trust minimized manner.

To start, write 5 questions you have about the Switchboard oracle protocol

## GPT

1. What are the key architectural components of the Switchboard oracle protocol,
   and how do they interact to ensure a trust-minimized environment?

2. How does the Switchboard protocol handle data acquisition, aggregation, and
   delivery to smart contracts? What makes it different from other oracle
   protocols?

3. What are the security measures employed by Switchboard to prevent malicious
   actors from manipulating data or disrupting the system? How does Switchboard
   mitigate the risks associated with the oracle problem?

4. How does Switchboard facilitate the decentralization of its oracle network?
   How does it ensure data authenticity, accuracy, and reliability in such a
   setup?

5. What are the potential applications of Switchboard in the evolving blockchain
   ecosystem? How can developers leverage its capabilities to enhance their
   DApps and smart contracts?

1. The following are the key architecture components of the Switchboard oracle
   protocol:

- Oracles: Nodes responsible for routing data on-chain on request
- Oracle Queues: Independent realm of round robin oracles which get assigned to
  update requests in a semi unpredictable manner.
- Permissions: Used to manually permit or revoke entities from joining the queue
- Aggregators: Defines the config for how and when data is sourced off-chain and
  routed on-chain along with an escrow to reward oracles for fulfilling requests

2. Switchboard is permissionless where anyone can join and contribute to the
   network. Permission accounts are used to control access level.

3. Oracles are always permitted to be whitelisted before joining to prevent bad
   actors from tainting the data.

4. Switchboard uses the median of oracle responses so multiple malicous reports
   wont skew the results. An Aggregator can set the number of responses before
   accepting a response.

5. Switchboard can be used to route ANY data including prices, weather, or the
   number of connected users.
