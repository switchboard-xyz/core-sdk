Protobuf definitions to instruct an oracle how to fetch, parse, and transform
data to bring it on-chain.

Switchboard oracles read on-chain job accounts to determine how to fetch and
respond to update request. An OracleJob is a collection of tasks that are
chained together to arrive at a single numerical value.

Switchboard tasks are executed sequentially with the output of the previous task
provided as the input to the next task in a chain. After the final task, the
TaskRunner will attempt to convert the running result to a numeric value.

**NOTE**: Some task do not consume the running input such as HttpTask,
WebsocketTask, and most of the fetch tasks. If the TaskRunner sees one of these
task types in the middle of a job definition, it will effectively reset the
running result.
